The lat\nter, with its teeming population <-f over four\nhundred million pe< pie, is the most valuable\nmarket on the face of the globe to every nation\n\u25a0josstased of manufacturing and commercial in\nterests.

Noi c of\nthem, however, are anxlou3 to take un anna\nacainst Russia or to ro to the length c f de\ncUrtric war upon her In order to keep these\nmarkets ocen. But they are all of them glad\nto find Japan disposed to undertake the work\nIn their stead, and that Is why they are giving\nto her their sympathy nnd their moral support.\nTo every i ne who has lived in the Orient and\nmho has acquired experience of the Asiatic\ncharacter tl.o question must occur as to what\nskgree of dependence can be placed up.in tli\"\n\u25a0ndertaking thai Corea, Manchuria and the rest\n\u2022f China will remain open to the trade of the\nUnited States arid of Europe, In the event of\nJapan obtaining control of the situation by\n\u25a0Mans of a< tual war, or perhaps, even, by more\ndiplomatic pressure. True. Russia has a singu\nlarly unfortunate record in the matter of the\nDon-fulfilment of official pled] \u25a0 and treaty\n\u2022bllgaUona. There are few countries, however,\nWhose skirt nre absolutely unsoiled in this\nconnection, and there is no guarantee whatso\never that Japan will not eventually follow In\nthla particular, too, the example set by so many\nWestern powers, and decline to live up to her\nprssnftses. The morality of t!;e Japanese mer\nel-ant in the matter of his obligations has long\nbeen a byword throughout the Orient, and BM\nfrequently been denounced In consular reports\nr.d In looks of travel. It remains to be *e.-u\nwhether the Japanese government will manifest\na loftier regard for Its promises, when the in\nterests of her merchants, of her manufacturers,\naid, Indeed, of the prosperity of the satin land\nsf the Rising Sun. are at stake.\nKhould, then, Japan attempt to reserve the\nChinese markets for her exclusive o \u2022\u2022. excluding ;\ntherefrom all those Western powers which are\nn<.w giving her that moral backing which is en\ncouraging her to resist the advaa ea of the Kir - '\nslahh. the situation will have become fraught\nwith much greater dltli. uttfes than it Is to-day.\nAlready the disposition of the < hlncSS govern\nn.cnt and people to confide In the Japanere\u2014\nthat Is to say, In fellow Ortentala and in fellow\nhi*thftis rather than In the Christian forelgn\nera\u2014is very marked. In the event of Japan ob\ntaining the upper l.ai.d In her present conflict\nwUh Russia, her prestige and her lafluenos\nwr.uld Inevitably become to such an extent\nparamount in China that the latter would sub\nm'.t entirely to her guidance. a victorious\nJapan would undoubtedly lead to the organtxa\ntlon and mobilization of the Chines* millions\nIrlo a vast and successful army. AVlth th. ir\nSimilarity of race, religion, history, Ideals and\ncustoms, the Japanese and the Chinese might\nSjuSckty develop Into a military entity the power\nof Which, once aroused and mobilized, would\ndvarf Into Insignificance any horde of conquer\nois tho tvorld baa ever seen.

The men are noted\nfor their ttmng* physical appearance, short\nand ruKK' d Stature, and their faces, which are\nnearly white, are covered with a long Krowth\nof hair, while they have extraordinarily lone\nbeards. The hair upon the bodies of the men\noften resembles a thick co.it, black and curly,\nextending to the extremities of the upper and\nlower limbs.

On the western coast there is Yongam\n|bo, near the northern boundary, and a few\npiles from the mouth of the Yalu Rl\\er. Here\nlhe Russians have leased a large tract of terri\ntory, and are now building forts, although they\ncaid primarily they only wanted the land for\ncutting timber.

Che\nmulpo is to Seoul, the capital of Corea, what\nthe harbor of Piraeus was to classic Athens. A\nrailroad Joins Chemulpo and Seoul, and It Is\nthrough this port that the capital city carries\non Its trade with China. A third port, and the\nmost Important of all, is Fusan, on the Bouth\nr-.-it-tf-rii extremity of the peninsula, which la the\nsouthern terminal of the Pusan-Beoul Railroad,\nFusan might be made a powerful naval station\nto control the straits between Corea and Japan.\nAt th\" present time the Japanese government\nexercises a sort (if commercial protectorate over\nthis port; and one of Russia's latest moves is to\nget the harbor Masnmpho, which is near l'usan.\nPort Lazaref, on the eastern shore of Oorea,\ncrashed by that branch of the warm Japan cur\nrent which enters the Corean Strait, is still an-\nOth< r harbor which would permit Russia to\nhave communication with the sea. summer and\nwinter.\nA third reason why Russia Is especially de\nilr< \"s of extending her rule south of tho Yalu\nl:;.' r is to obtain the rich, hard woods of the\n< i forests, and the gold, copper and sil\nv r of Its mines.

He will never obtain an un\nbiassed opinion of country life by talking with\na country resi lent. In the summer time he will\nfind him full of boasts and In the winter full\nof explanations. The only way to get a genu\nine, aboveboard, straightforward, unprejudiced\nconception of country life Is to visit a. suburban\nfriend unexpectedly and see for one's self.\nSuch a visit would better be made in the dead\nof winter than in midsummer. The commuter's\nstatements regarding the beauties of nature In\nJune and July contain a certain amount of\ntruth that do not need Investigation by a de\ntective. Everybody knows that trees and grass\ngrow in summer, and that they are pleasant to\nlook upon.\nAnd yet the commuter always talks as if he\nwere the first to discover that the country la\npleasanter than the city in hot weather. When\nhe eomel In from his rural home on a sultry\nmorning and a.sks you how you slept la.st ni^ht,\nyou know, of course, that he slept all right him\ns.-lf. and that he only wants tlur c;[ ;>ortunity to\nsay so. And wh->n ho gels the chance, lie will\ntell you how cool the nights ure at Slumber\nCorners, urid how the wind always circulates\nthrough that wonderful house of his, and how\ndelightful Is the chirping of the crlcketa at\nnight, and how healthful his cUMren are, how\nmuch they weigh, how much they eat, how\nmuch they look like him. and all because they\ncan live iv the country.\nNO STEAM HEATED FLAT FOR HIM.\nthe mtarbaa \u00absw\u00abnei*\u00ab contempt for city life often erta a Jar m winter, when the servant goes m\nstrike, and ho has to tend Uxe> furoa.ee and empty the ashes himself.\nWhen all other themes are exhausted, the\nsuburbanite Is always ready to dilate on air.\nThis subject of air Is especially dear to him, and\noffers a boundless field for his Intellect to dis\nport itself. He will tell you. to begin with, how\nmuch purer the air is in Slumber Corners than\nin New- York. Then again, Slumber Corners Is\nli>o feet higher than New-York, a fact which\nproves that the air of Slumber Corners is dryer\nthan that of New-York, and especially benefi\ncial for throat and lungs. Give him a change\nand he will tell how he once suffered from asth\nma, catarrh, bronchitis, tonsUltls, laryngitis,\nwith a threat of tuberculosis, before he left\nNew-York for Slumber Corners. And should\nyou suggest that his Manhattan ofh>e, on the\ntwentieth floor. Is even higher than the beauti\nful hamlet wh-re he lives, he will tell you that\nNew- York air is full of germs. In Slumber Cor\nners germs cannot exist, although he may not\nsay that Slumber Corners is too slow for gorms.\nIf anything Is ev.-r said about the long ride\non the ferry or the train the suburbanite Is\nready with statistics to provt how rapidly he\ntravels 1..i0k and forth each day. He has flg\nored it all out to the fraction of a minute. If\nho can shave an hour tewa one or two minutes\nhe docs to. much as the storekeeper marks\ndown his goods so as to remove the dollar sign.\nHe telLs you it is only a six minute walk from\nhis house to the station, that the train la an\nexpress. naJOttsj no stops, that it comes the\nnineteen rnlles between Slumber Corners and\nlioboken In thirty-five minutes, and that the\nterry makes the river trip tn fourteen inl;;ut\u00ab.\\a.\nThe walk np from the station to the office takes)\nonly four minutes. And bo he figures that be\nmak< s the entire journey in fifty-nine minute*\nand adds, exultantly:\n\"It's so much more convenient than The\nBronx, where we once lived. Then it took me\na wh.le hour.\"\nAnd should some Manhattanite ask him if the\nmosquitoes ever bother him. he always answers\nthat Slumber Cornt-rs is wonderfully exempt\nfrom such a st, and that although all the rest\nof the State of New- Jersey may swarm with\nmosquitoes, they have never entered the Kden\nwhere he has his home. The screens in hi*\nwindows and doors and around his porch, he ex\nplains, are only to keep out Hies.\nWith the coming of winter, however, the com\nmuter grows less boastful. He is not so r<ady\nto exploit the remarkable virtues of Slumber\nCorners as formerly. When he comes into the\noffice with his rubbers covered with mud, his\novercoat wrinkled as if he had slept in it over\nnight, and a thin veil of ashes on bis hat. he\nnever calls anybody's attention to these details.\nAnd when a snowstorm sweeps down on the\ncountry and the river thickens with ice, and he\ngets down to the office two hours' late, he\nmerely answers inquiries by saying that he\nmissed the train, or that there was a change La\nthe schedule, or that the baby wasn't well, and\nhe wanted to have #\u25a0 talk with the doctor.\nShould the city mxm. however, make his coun\ntry friend an early and sudden visit some winter\nmorning. h\u00ab might learn that the baby's illness\nor a change in the timetable was by no means\nthe sole cause of the commuter's tardiness.\nCould he obtain the whole truth, he would dis\ncover that there are certain cold, stern realities\nabout country life In the winter that his subur\nban friend had never hinted at. For example,\ngo a nmmmg made dark by a snowstorm the\ncommuter generally oversleeps. When the\nalarm clock go*\u00bbs off. he opens his eyes for a\nmoment, sees how dark it Is, and then makes\nhimself believe the clock was set two hours to*\nearly. The snow Is coming down so quietly\nand the ground is so thickly carpeted that pass-\nIng teams do not arouse him. It Is not until one\nof the children, falls out of bed or the cook\ndrops a tray of dishes on the kitchen floor that\nhe begins to realize that the night has passed.\nOn such a morning the furnace fire always goes\nout It has kept up a heroic fight all night for\nits existence, but the battle was too protracted\nand reinforcements came too late. He tries ta\nwash bis face, but finds that the pipes are\nfrozen. He looks for a clean towel, but all the\ntowels that are not soiled were washed yester\nday and now hang like so many sheets of metal\non the line In the back yard.\nShould there be no cook, the commuter crawls\ndownstairs and builds the fire himself. He ts\ncompelled to do this, whether he wants to or not.\nIt is only an hour before train time, and he\nknows that his wife will certainly need another\nhalf hour to curl her hair before she would even\nbe prepared to build a fire. The ashes this\nmorning choke the range as If they had I -a\naccumulating for week.-*, and the wood sputter*\nand refuses to burn, Of course the wood \u00bbai\nleft outdoors all night.\nAfter the fires are built, the commuter realize*\nthat he must clear \u25a0 path to the street anil\nclean the sidewalk. If he doesn't, he will cause\ntrouble not only at home, but throughout Slum\nber Corners. His wife will certainly catch a\ncold, which she will attribute to the soft snow\nshe \"had to wade through\" and which he did\nnot shovel away. And all the citizens who pass\nIlls gate will look at that uncleaned path, and\nsizo up the situation in one of two ways.

Nor will It go before the\nHague tribunal as a party to any proceedings\ngrowing out of that secession. It Is said that\nto do either of these things would be to commit\nthe administration to an admission that It had\nbeen guilty of wronging Colombia.\nOn the other hand, it is again announced that\nthe United States stands ready to do everything\nIn its power to bring about an amicable under\nstanding between Colombia and Panama. It\nmay be that Panama will consent to go before\nthe Hapue tribunal with Colombia and allow\nthat tribunal to decide whether 'or not Panama\nshall make any concessions to Colombia on ac\ncount of the severance of political ties.\nIt Is certain that tne United States government\nwould look with favor on the assumption by\nPanama of some small liability, to make good\nthe heavy loss which Colombia has suffered. Th-;\ngovernment is even willing to go to the extent\nof guaranteeing the performance by Panama of\nany duty ar^d obligation she may assume toward\nColombiP, and exchanges on this basis between\nthe interested parties are now In progress.\nHALES PACIFIC MOVE.\nWould Ask President to Tender\nGood Offices to Colombia.\n[FnOM TITE TRIPrN-E BUREAU.]\nWr.shingrton, Jan. 13.\u2014 The beneficial effect of\nSenator Hale's paciHc diplomacy as exercised in\nyesterday's debate was clearly observable to\nday, and out cf the confusion of thought which\nwas prevalent In many quarters at the close of\nyesterday's session there has crystallized a be\nlief that the adoption of the resolution whirh\nMr. Hale offered to-day as a substitute for that\noffered by Mr. Bacon may prove a judicious\nmove.\nThe first evidence of the beneficial effect of\nMr. Hale's tactics Is the determination of Sen\nator Lodge to withdraw his motion to lay the\nBacon resolution on the table\u2014 a course which,\nwhile it seemed imperative because of the dan\nger of misleading the Colombians, would In\nevitably have elicited acrimonious- opposition\nfrom the Democrats.\nThe Bacon and Hale resolutions will now go to\nthe Committee on Foreign Relation*, where they\nwill doubtless be made the subject of consider\nable debate, and It Is by no mean 3 unlikely that\nthe result will be the reporting of a resolution\nalong the lines suggested by Mr. Hale.\nSuch a resolution would undoubtedly afford a\nbridge whereby a number of Democratic Sen\nators could cross the objections to which they\nare already committed, and several have pri\nvately expressed the hope that the Repul leans\nwould give them such an opportunity.\nAnother consideration which will be brought\nto the attention of the committee will be the\npossible assistance which such a resolution\nmight afford to the Colombian leaders, who\nthoroughly appreciate the futility of resisting\nthe course of events, but are experiencing diffi\nculty in restraining their followers. Secretary\nHay has already tendered the good offices of the\nUnited States In the disagreement between the\nRepublic of Panama and Colombia, and from %\nEtrlctly logical point of view the Hale resolution\nis unnecessary, but as a pure matter of expedi\nency, which might prove a soothing application\nto the Colombians, who are stricken with re\nmorse at their own injudicious course, it might\nhave a beneficial effect on the situation, and\nthere are a number of Senators who will advo\ncate its adoption on that ground.\nThe resolution is as follows:\nWheieas, The State of Panama, formerly a part\nof the Republic of Colombia, has seceded from that\nrepublic anc has set up a government, republican\nin form, under the name of the Republic of Pan\nama; ami,\nWhereas, The lndrp^nden^e of said Republic of\nPanama has bten recopnlzfd by tho United States\nand by many other nations; and.\nWhereas.

Although\nrelating in Its principal provisions to questions\nof commerce and navigation, removing restric\ntions which have hampered them both in China,\nit also treats of a number of questions of great\nimportance to the people of the two countries.\nFor example. It defines the rights and privileges\nof the diplomatic and consular officers and of\nAmerican citizens, especially missionaries, resid\ning China, and Insures the latter enjoyment of\nrights which they have only had In the past\npractically by toleration. The treaty also deals\nwith trademarks, copyrights and patents. In\nsuring them a fair degree of protection in Cblna\n\u2014a thing which they have had very little of In\nthe past.\nPerhaps the provision of the treaty which In\nterests most the public is the opening of two\nnew localities In Manchuria to foreign trade\n\u2014the city of Moukden and the town of An-\nTung, or Shao, as it is frequently called, on the\nYalu River. It Is to be noted In this connec\ntion that the Japanese and Chinese treaty, the\nratifications of which were exchanged yester\nday at Peking, secures also to lnternationil\ntrade the opening of the port of Tatung Kou.\nabout thirteen miles below An-Tung, and at the\nmouth of the Yalu. It Is highly probable that\u00ab\nthe presence in these localities at an early date\nof American consular officers and those of other\nnationalities!\u2014 for all the nations having treaties\nwith China acquire by our treaty, and that with\nJapan, the right to establish consulates at these\nplaces\u2014will greatly tend to the establishment of\norder In this much disturbed border land of\nChina, and will powerfully contribute toward\nlnsurinp the principles of the \"open door.\" to\nwhich this country stands Irrevocably comm't\n\u25a0 well as aiding In insuring the lntesrrlty\nr>!- Chtaw and Its administrative control over its\nManchurian provinces.\"\nThe exchange of ratifications took place at the\nState Department by appointment at 11 o'clock.\nThe Chinese Minister was accompanied by his\nsecretary. Everything had been arranged, and\nMr. Conger had informed the department that\nthf\u00bb Chinese government placed an exchange\ncopy of the treaty In h.~ hands yesterday. This\nis held to be equivalent to the delivery of the\ndocument to the United States government as\nrequired by the treaty itself. So Secretary Hay\nand the Chinese Minister joined to-day In the\nsignature of the protocol, reciting the fact that\nratifications had been exchanged. The Chinese\nMinister will receive a copy of the treaty by\nthe State Department, which he will forward\nto his government for deposit In the imperial\narchives In Peking, and when Mr. Congers\ncopy reaches Washington It will be placed in\nthe State Department Library.\nThe treaty is\u00bb now an accomplished fact, and\nft remains only to appoint the necessary con\nsqls at Moukden and An-Tung. The President\nhas selected these consuls from men of expe\nrience already in the consular service, and con\nsequently able to open the new field to trade\nwith the least possible delay. Their names will\nbo sent to the Senate as soon as Congress makes\nprovision for their salary, which the State De\npartment hopes will be done speedily. It is re\ngarded as extremely desirable that such rights\nps the United States has acaulred in Manchuria.\nas to China shall be fully established and as\nserted in advance of any possible war that might\naffect that vast territory to the extent of a\nchange of sovereignty.\nCHINA-JAPAN TREATY.\nProviding a Place of Residence for\nForeigners in PeJcing.\nWashington, Jan. 13 \u2014The Japanese Minister hers.\nDr. Takahira. to-day made public the text of the\ntreaty ratified, yesterday at Peking between Japan\n:'.\u2022\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 ''Mna.

Buchanan aa Envoy Extraordinary\nand Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic\nof Panama, which wai accomplished nnally to\nday with only sixteen Democratic votes in oppo\nsition, is, regarded as extremely gratifying, con\nstituting, as it does, a formal re -osmition by the\nSenate of the new republic\nThis nomination was sent to the Senate on De\ncember 12 and confirmed five days later, but on\nthe ll>th Senator Morgan moved to reconsider\nthe action of the Senate, on the ground that the\nnomination had not received sufficient considera\ntion, and since that time the question has been\nrending. The molion of Senator Lodge, made to\nday in executive session, to lay on the table the\nmotion of the Senator from Alabama, was\npromptly carried by a vote of 38 to IG. and re\nmoved all doubt, if any had existed, regarding\nthe attitude of the Senate toward the naw re\npublic.\nAdded significance Is given by the small num\nber of Democratic Senators who rallied to Sen\nator Gorman's call to do everything possible to\nprevent formal recojrnition of Panama. Al\nthough nearly twice that number of Democratic\nSenators are in the city, only sixteen were pres\nent this morning, when, it was understood, the\nquestion would come to a vote, thus showing\nhow halfhearted Is the support which Mr. Gor\nman is receiving in his efforts to lead his Demo\ncratic colleagues against the canal policy of the\nadministration.\nThere is further significance in the similarity.\nIn so far aa numbers go, between the total Dem\nocratic vote and the poll of Senators on that\nside of the chamber on the question of ratifying\nthe treaty made recently by Senators Dubois\nand Carmack. It will be remembered that the\npoll showed only seventeen Democratic Senators\nwho were willing to pledge themselves against\nthe ratification of the treaty, and, while the\nrecord of pairs may show a larger number of\nDemocrats opposed to Mr. Buchanan*! con\nfirmation, their opposition was of such a half\nhearted character us to lead them to stay away\nfrom the session, at which they knew they would\nbe called on to place themselves on rec r<i.\nGenerally speaking, the situation among the\nDemocrats is simple. They are trying to con\nvince themselves that the administration vio\nlated International law in its relations with Pan\nama and would be delighted to defeat the con\nstruction of the Panama Canal, but, apart from\na few extreme radloals. they well appreciate\ntha*. any determined opposition to the canal\nwould be opposition to the will of tho people and\nwould niore likely than not prove harmful to\ntheir personal welfare in th^lr States.\nThe vote to-day was on party lines, with the\nexception that Senator ifcCreary, of Kentucky,\nvoted with the Republicans.

Bryan, it was learned last night,\nhas ass-nted to an arrangement thereby ex-\nFenator Charles A. Town?, of Minnesota, now\na. resident of this city find a personal friend of\nCharles F. Murphy, Is to write a platform for\neoaeAderation by the next National Democratic\nConvention.\nThis plan v.-as agreed on at a conference at\nthe Victoria Hotel a week ago, following the\nSaturday night reception riven for Mr. Bryan\nliy Mi friends after his return from Europe.\nAt the conference were Mr. Bryan, City Court\nJudge Samuel Seabury, Melvln G. Pallleer. Mr.\nTown*, General Weaver, of lowa, and one or two\nothers. A good deal of the talk was about the\nplatform. The tone of Mr. Bryan's remarks in\ndicated that the Democracy should not be al\nlowed to take any backward st*p, and that it\nwould be better to put forward a platform that\n\u2022\u2022rhould mean relief from certain industrial\nconditions rather than to compromise with evil.\"\nMr. Town?, it is paid, ventured the suggestion\nth\u00a3t he had several ideas on what the platform\nrhould contain, and Mr. Bryan smilingly eug\ngested that it would be a good idea for him to go\n*hesid and formulate a platform which could be\nshown to the party leaders, and on which notes\ncould be compared prior to the assembling of\nthft convention. It was suggested that it would\ntiot do to have it understood that anything that\nMr. Town* might submit in the way of a rough\ndraft should be used to usurp the function of the\ncommittee on resolutions of the national con\nvention.\nIt was said last night at the Hoffman House\nthat nothing that Mr. Towne draws up in the\nform of a platform will be regarded as in any\nway official. It is believed that Mr. Metcalf,\nchairman of the committee on resolutions of the\nconvention in 10<K>. will draft a platform, and\nfor the conservatives Senator Gorman and ex-\nX senator David B. Hill are expected to contribute\n\u25a0ft tentative main .planks.\nCLUB OVER THEIR HEADS.\nRadical Democrats' Plan to Name\nMan After Their Own Heart.\nDENVER MAN LEADS MOVEMENT.\n\u25a0 was learned yesterday that the radical\nDemocrats of the Western and Southwestern\nStates have organized a movement designed to\nclub the next Democratic National Convention\nInto the adoption of a radical platform and the\nnomination of a candidate who will carry out\nth\u00ab ideas of the platform if he is elected.\nTh\u00ab head and front of the movement seems to\n*>\u2022 J. A. Edgerton, of Denver, who will soon\nissue a call for a roundup of all the leaders of\nthe Populists, Middle of the Road Populists,\nSilver Republicans and other radical elements in\nthe Democratic ranks in the West at St. Louis\non February 22, at which time a call will be\ninaued for a national convention of the radicals\na dey or two after the adjournment of the regu\nlar* at St. Louis In July. If the candidate and\nplatform of the regulars do not suit the radicals\nthey will go ahead and adopt a platform and\nnominal* a ticket of their own. The radicals\nwill then be In a position to take advantage of\neny Bartons split In the regular convention. If\nany element in the convention bolts, the radi\ncals, vith their national convention immedi\nately following the other, will be in shape to\ndo business\" with them.\nThere is a strong sentiment among the radi\ncals in favor of William R. Hearst, but at the\nv >\u25a0< \u2022 time they are not \"1 ed up\" to him. The\nmovement is an outcome of a plan outlined last\nJuly at a conference of the radical leaders in\nDenver, the home of Mr. Edperton. At that\nconference were Noah Tibbals. a Nebraska\nnewspaper man, a personal friend of William J.\nBryan, and J. A. Parker, of Louisville, of the\nMiddle of the Road Populists. These men have\ni'?en in this city of late, and have things in\nshape for co-operating with the bolters la cap*\nof a split at St. Louis. The radicals allege that\nihfy will poll a million votes this year if they\nrun an Independent tickc-t. and that* the regular\nDemocratic candidate will lose all these if he.\nfioteat =uit them and is not running on a plat\nform that conform? to their ideas. One of their\nsin ins 1 1 1 is for an uncompromising warfare\nagainst the trusts.\nCROKER MAY STAY AWAY.\nMl Mr. Cram He May Decide\nXever to Return Here.\nJ.

Moreover, It is the\nbelief of the officials here that Japan's steady\nIncrease in her demands is due largely to her\nbelief that Russia is desirous of avoiding war,\nand that therefore it is safe to push demands to\nthe furthest limits.\nThus far only a brief synopsis of the various\n(i\u00ab-m\u00abmds of Japan has been given to the public,\nend it li said that th\u00ab* oxact text of the reply Is\nnecessary in order to show the gradual expan\nsion of the Japanese contentions. In particular\nit 1.1 the official view that Japan's present de\nmands for the integrity of China and full recog\nnition of Chinese authority uver Manchuria rep\nresent an important advance over the early rep\nresentations. It is pointed out that at the out\nset Japan and practically all the powers recog\nnized Russia's special Interests in Manchuria,\nbut the view now prevails that Japan's de\nmands seek to minimize and restrict these spe\ncial interests within impossible limits.\nThe diplomat summed up state and official\nsentiment here by saying that Japan's claims\nare \u25a0 onsidered to have reached an extreme which\nis licit likely to receive favorable consideration\nfrom Russia, and that at the same time this does\nnot give Japan moral justification to resort to\nwar.\n7). i HDAXELLES KEPT SAFE.\nBritish Officials Sure That fftJttfa\nWill Xot Break Treaty.\nKING EDWARD APPEALS TO CZAR.\nLondon, Jan. 16.\u2014 1n the opinion of the British\ngovernment the end of this week does not mark\nany change In the Far Eastern crisis, which\nmore than ever keeps diplomatic circles in Lon\ndon in a state of anxiety.\nThe latest and, if it had been true, the most\nserious statement \u2014 namely, that Russia intended\nto risk sending her Black Sea fleet through the\nDardanelles\u2014 received to-day a positive denial\nfrom the Foreign Office. Baron Hayashl. the\nJapanese Minister, visited Downing Street this\nafternoon, nnd was told that after making\nminute Inquiries the British authorities were\nconvinced that the report was unfounded.\nRegarding the main issue. Baron Hayashi and\nthe Foreign Office had no information. Not even\nthe Czar's pacific utterances, however, can dis\npel the fear which pervades British officials that\nRussia will not yield. King Edward continues\nto use his personal Influence to an almost un\nprecedented extent to persuade the Czar to\nmaintain peace, but the King's ministers appear\nto have practically given up hope that n. resort\nto arms can be averted, though even the most\npessimistic persons do not look for nny culmina\ntion of the crisis within three weeks.\nThe suggested Intervention, in the shape of\ntendering their good offices, on the part of other\npowers is now universally declared here to be\nquite impossible.\nHow determined Japan is to face all the even\ntualities can be judged from the fact that she\nis negotiating in England for the construct\nof four battleships, not two battleship?, as pre\nviously reported. The negotiations are not yet\ndosed, but the contract is likely to be taken\nup by the largest English firm within a week.\nThe firm In question Kays that it is satisfied\nJapan is able to carry on a possible war long\nenough to pay for and use the vessels, which\nnecessarily could not be ready under two years.\n\"The Spectator\" now regards v&t as inevi\ntable, in which ft merely follows up Its own\nsignificant -s>\u00abrui*Bnt\u2014 that 'a Russo-\nJapanese war would, be. to Great Britain's ad\nvantage, so long an Great Britain is only \"art\nonlooker and while th* straggle does not in\nvolve any other power. \"The Spectator\" has\npreviously pointed out -in guarded language tnat\nsurh a war was likely to leave both Russia and\nJapan crippled, neither gaining a great advan\ntage over the other, which suggest? the deduc\ntion current In official circles here, that in this\nevent Great Britain would he in a better posi\ntion to foster her sphere of influence In the\nFar East, unmenaced by the fear of Japan be\ncoming a too paramount power in that quarter\nof the globe. Baron Hayashi said humorously\nto-night:\nGreat Britain and America might \\\\\u00bb-li raise a.\nsubscription In our behalf, for if war results and\nwe win. they are bound to benefit by it.\nLAMGER GUARD AT SEOUL.\nSixty More United States Marines in\n( 'ity\u2014 Sufficient Protection.\nS-oul, Jan. 10.\u2014 Th\u00ab American guard at the\nI'riited States Embassy has bMO increased.\nSixty additional marines arrived here last night\nand are quartered In the city at the electric\npower company's building.

Jap in has an ample supply\nof troopships and auxiliary rrui .-\u25a0 ra.\nThe personnel <-f the Japanese navy in 1902\nconsisted of 2 admirals, 1) vice-admirals, 2,\"> rear\nadmirals. C 5 captains, 110 commanders. 167\nlieutenant commanders, 22' lieutenants. 305\nsub-lieutenants, besides engineers, medical offi- i\ncers, etc.. and SMSBB sailors. The standard of\ndiscipline maintained on board hi that of the\nBritish navy. Their offlcen have either been\ntrained on board British ships or have been in\nstructed by British otllcers. A naval college is\nalso maintained by the government. The ships ;\nhave been exercised constantly, and their offi- j\ncers were tested in the Chinese war and found to i\nhave courage, capacity and resourcefulness.\nThe Russian navy consists of 18 battleships. 5\narmored cruisers, 11) cruisers, protected and\notherwise; 7 torpedo gunboats. \u2022_'\u00bb; destroyers. 53\ntorpedo boats, built or building, and 2 sub- '\nmarine tor;edo boats. Of these different classes,\nnineteen are stationed In the Black Sea, and\ncould not be of service in the Far Kast. A few\nothers also are In the Baltic and Mediterranean. :\nThe chief vessels of the Russian navy are either\nIn Eastern waters or on the way there. The\nfleet with which Japan will have to cope is made\nup of eight battleships, five armored cruisers\nand eight protected crolsera, besides a number\nof destroy CIS and torpedo boats, some of which\nare now on the way to the East, the total dis\nplacement of which, excluding the destroyers,\nand torpedo boats, is 131.173 tons. of the bat\ntleships, the largest are equal In displacement to I\nthe smaller battleships of Japan. Their gun pro- !\ntect is less and none cl then throw so much\nmetal at a broadside tire. They also have the\ndisadvantage of Dot being of equal speed, three\nbeing able to malu 19 knots, two 18 and three\n17. Thai reduces their effectiveness as a squad- :\nron, as they cannot mari'iMivre at a greater ,\nspeed than the Slowest In this respect they are\nInferior to the Japanese vessels. The disparity\nin the weight of metal which the Russian ar\nmored cruisers can throw at a broadside Is !\ngreater in the class of armored cruisers. Not :\none of the Russian cruisers of this class can ;\nthrow within two thousand pounds as much as !\nany of the Japanese. In the matter of speed \u2022\nthere is a lack of homogeneity, as In the case of ;\nthe battleships. The Mayan has a speed of 22\nknots, the Gromboi and Itossia of 20, the Rurik\nIS and the Dmitr* Don-skoi 15. Three of these\ncruisers, however, are larger than any of the\nJapanese cruisers of the san:e class. In pro\ntected cruisers Japan has the advantage aLso In\nthe weight of metal which can be thrown and In\nnumbers, but not in regard to speed, as one of\nthe Russian cruisers of this class is reckoned as\nhaving a speed of 25 knots, three at 23 knots,\none at 22 and three at 20. None of the armored ;\ncruisers are considered as good as those pos- \u25a0\nsesred by Japan. The principal contrast which\nthe Russian squadron presents to the Japanese\nla In lack of homogeneity, in weight of metal\nwhich can be thrown and thickness of protective i\narmor. Russia also has the disadvantage of\nhaving no place in the Kast where she can make\nrepairs to her fleet The docks at Port Arthur\nare not completed and those at Vladivostok are\nnow shut in by Ice. There are In the entire\nnavy 10 admirals. 28 vice-admirals, 37 rear ad\nmirals, 102 captains. 202 commanders 1.542\nJunior officers, 503 engineers. 702 medical and\ncivil officers, 102 naval yard officers and sailors\nto bring the total up to 00,000 men.

Th.- present pension law\nis so liberal that any honest veteran who has\nany need for a pension can have one. and many\na dishonest veteran is able to take advantage of\nIts provisions to get a pension when he is not\nin need and in no i*e incapacitated. A service\n\u25a0 pension of $12 a month to the few who are not\nnow enjoying the government's bounty would\nperhaps not overwhelm the Treasury. An the\nturn of the tide In pension expenditure under\nth\u00ab present law appears to have been reached,\nand a slight decrease noted, it seems to ha in\norder to provide new outlet* for government\nmoney, for it would never do in the world to\nlet the business of the pension attorneys go on\ndecreasing through the failure of '.'(ingress to\nprovide an unending strenni of client*.\nBut whether the cyst be small or great, the\nprinciple of a service pension is vicious. I*\npatriotism to lie appraised on a cash basis? Is\nevery man who shouldered a musket at his\ncovntTT's call, irrespective of his needs or his\nwounds, going to become a hanger-on of the\nTreasury? The pension attorneys want this,\nand a ienttment has l\u00ab\u00bben artfully worked up in\nIts favor among veterans who probably have\nnot carefully thought out all that it Implies.\nBut we do not believe that th*\u00bb rreat body of\nbr\u00bbT\u00bb and patriotic men, who are proud of\ntheir part In saving the Union, wish to lower\nthe standard of devotion for future generations\nand teach the world that men who do not need\npewrtisi thick that they inun be pubsidized\nfor having been patriotic W#\u00bb do not believe\nthey cars thus to cheapen their service. To the\nveteran who for any reason needs aid, and to\n(Lose dependent upon him. a grateful country\nwill erar bs delighted to minister.

The\nTreasury can doubtless endure the proposed\ndrain upon It. but can it endure the establish\nment of the Idea that, instead of citizens owing\nfreely their services to the government, the\ngovernment owes a living, regardless of his\nability to support himself, to every citizen who\never by any chance dons its uniform for ninety\ndays?\nCOXYICTB OX THE ROADS.\n(ioort roads are worth all and more than all\nthat they cctrt under the operation of the law\nwhich provides for State and county co-opera\ntion in New-York. But if tnere is a way of\nlessening the expense without impairing the\nquality of the work or harming any interest\nit ought to be adopted. The consequence would\nbe not a reduction of the amount of money ap\nplicable to the purpose, but an increase in the\nnumber of miles Improved. There is reason to\nbelieve that object might be attained by the em\nployment of convict labor, with great advantage\nto public and prisoners. In Rome Western and\nSouthern States this policy baa been Increas\ningly pursued within the h-v few years, and\nofficial reports of Its success are not contra\ndicted by other testimony. During the last\nsummer the experiment was made in Schenec\ntfldy County, to the satisfaction of the local\nauthorities, ** -vre learn from an interesting ac\nccunt of it in \"The Municipal Journal and En\ngineer.\"\nAfter an investigation of the subject by a\ncommittee of the Board of Supervisors, a con\ntract was made with the town of Glenvllle for\nthe macadamizing of a particularly bad piece\nof road, and in the course of seven mouths,\nwith an average force of twenty prisoners from\nthe county Jail, two and a half miles were put\ninto excellent condition. The specifications pre\nscribed by the State where State aid is fur\nnished *ere strictly followed, but the county\nand town bore all the expense, which, how\never, w\u00dfi not g.vater than their share would\nhave been under the provisions of the Iligbie-\nArmstrong law. One guard to eight prisoners\nwas found to be enough, the men, as a rule,\nwere cheerful and industrious, end the citizens\nsuffered no annoyance or apprehension. Occa\nsionally a convict was Indisposed to exert him\nself, but he 6O<in changed his mind after being\nput on short rations. The committee made it a\npolnr, when a prisoner became noted for faiih\nful service and good behavior, to give him em\nploy rneut at current wages when his sentence\nexpired. The official report frankly concedes\nthat some questions were not completely solved\nby this brief experiment on a email scale, but\nin general the results fully justined the expecta\ntions aroused by similar operations in other\nparts of the country.\nIt has long been a grave and at times a really\ndistressing question how to find employment for\nprisoners without putting them Into harmful\ncompetition with free labor. To keep them In\nidleness Is a cruelty to them and a heavy bur\nden on the community. Iload building Js work\nwhich needs to be intelligently supervised, but\notherwise requires littie Etcill. It is not work In\nwhich craftsmen would dislike to 6oe convicts\nemployed. It Is more likely to be congenial\nthan obnoxious to the convicts themselves, since\nit giv\u00abs them some of the advantages of lib\nerty, while at the same time it tends to eradi\ncate criminal propensities. The chance of es\ncspes Is small, both because of the watcn kept\nand because a man under sentence for a com\nparatively light offence Is not often Inclined to\naccept such a risk of having his term of im\nprisonment extended. Undoubtedly the plan Is\nsubject to some objections, and it Is possible\nthat they might prove more serious In this State\nthan they have been found to be in the \\Yest\nand South, though we see no reason to accept\nthat hypothesis. At all events, the question\nis deserving of attentive consideration, for It\nseems to contain at least a partial solution of\nan embarrassing problem and to hi' adapted to\nthe promotion of great public improvement.\nf'RLSIDEXT ELIOT OX LIBERTY.\nIn his address to college men at the reception\nof the Brooklyn Tnlversity Club, on Friday\nevening, President Eliot took up a question\nwhich has been before discussed by other lead\ners of public opinion, and came to the same\nconclusion, that true American liberty is gravely\nmenaced by associations of employers on the\none hand and employes on the other. His ad\nmirable and impreHslve utterance should have\ngreat Influence In arousing educated men to the\nsinister meaning of the present day drift to\ngrind individual liberty and crush out individ\nual opportunity between the upper and nether\nmillstones of Intolerant and exclusive organ\nizations. Educated men have been too much in\nclined to accept standard* of business ethics as\nthey found them, enter the service of liberty de\nstroying corporations that offered them advance\nment, and make terms with liberty destroying\nlabor union.\" when it would conduce to their\nbusiness success. The Brooklyn men who heard\nPresident Eliot's calm, clear and convincing ex\nposition of the present state of affairs must\nhave bans aroused to a new appreciation of the\ngravity of the task which they have to preserve\nfreedom, a task which, in spite of warnings,\nthey and other happy-go-lucky Americans are\nprone to estimate lightly.\nIt is somewhat startling to find President\nEliot quietly announcing, not as a figure of\nspeech, but v.\" an actual simple fact, that In\nBoston to-day there Is less liberty than there\nwas in 177.\">. Our ancestors fought King George\nbecause he would not give them enough liberty\nin that year. They endured a long war, and\nthen established a government with a consti\ntution to secure the blessings of liberty to them\nselves and their posterity. Less liberty for\ntheir posterity now In Boston than when they\nr\u00ab\"-rolt\u00ab\u00bbd against a petty tax on tea, which inter\nfered with nobody's comfort or ability to earn\na living' where and as he chose? Yet, If we con\nsider, we shall pee that the statement is liter\nally true. King George never dreamed of such\ninterference with the colonists at the free citi\nzens of the United States and the common\nwealth of Massachusetts and of every other\ncommonwealth in th^ land dally endure at the\nhands of Irresponsible combinations which have\nusurped the power of telling them who may\nbuild their house* and at what price, whom\nthey may employ and at what wages. It haa\nbecome a well known fact that in many cities\nthe workers and the employers in the building\ntrades are in a combination to defraud and\ntyrannize over the citizens. When a house Is\nto be built a corrupt circle decides who Is to bid\nfor it at an exorbitant price and what bogu*\nbids are to be put In to support It. The owner\nis helpless. If he rebels he can find no other\ncontractor to do the work, or, If he does, a\nstrike will put a stop to the endeavor.\nSimilar conditions exist in other lines of bnsi\nnf\u00ab. Between the tyrannical rule of the trust\non the one hand and the labor union on the\nother, whether the two work in opposition or In\nharmony, the average citizen Is helpless. Every\naction of hi* life is controlled by these forces.\nHe Is subjected by them to extortion; hln enn-\nTenlence, his business, even his health and iife,\nare ruthlessly sacrificed to their prerogative^\nfor which they are more eelnsh, and more ambi\ntious, and more unscrupulous than King George\never was for th? power and prestige of the\nBritish Crown. It Is time for educated mea\nand men of Colonial ancestry to awaka to th\u00a9\ndanger, and President Eliot performs a public\nservice when he oses his grwt Influence wrer\ntbcai to work for the aafaguardlof\u2014rr.tbcr\nNKW-YOHK DAILY TRIBUNE, {SUNDAY. JANUARY 17. 1904.\nthan the recovery\u2014 \u00b0^ Amprioan liberty from\nthe despotism -whirl) has grown up within our\nown borders. *\nIV IX ADEQUATE PENALTY.\nYesterday's issue of The Tribune told in\ngraphic language the story of a runaway in\nFifth -a ye. A wine merchant's heavy delivery\nwag-on, drawn by two big Normandy horses,\nKtood baited at Thirty-nlnth-st., while the driver\nwent into a nearby shop to collect a bill. The\nhorses took fright at some street noise and broke\non a run down Fifth-aye. Their wild career was\nnot checked until they reached Thirty-second-st\nOn the way down they had thrown traffic in\nthe avenue into a panic, scattered pedestrians,\nsmashed into two passenger vehicles and in\njured their occupants, and incidentally endan\ngered many lives. The driver guilty of leaving\nthe team unwatched on the sidewalk was ar\nrested, and was discharged on payment of a\n$5 line.\nWe cannot but think his dismissal with such\na penalty a burlesque both on law and on com\nmon sense. As the event proved, his leaving\nhis team un watched was palpable criminal neg\nligence. He had no right to endanger the lives\nof others in order to do an errand clearly incon\nsistent with his duties as a teamster. If he\nwas instructed by his employer to collect bills\nand take chances on the good behavior of his\nhorses, he and the employer were equally guilty\nof criminal recklessness. Both should be held\nresponsible, in that case, for the injuries their\nfolly was the means of inflicting on innocent\npassersby.\nThe public is entitled to adequate protection\nagainst street perils, and to adequate redress. if\nthose perils are due to the gross and deliberate\ncarles\u00dfuess of delivery wagon drivers or deliv\nery wagon owners. If a fine of $5 Is the maxi\nmum penalty for such an offence as that com\nmitted yesterday in Fifth-aye., our criminal\nlaws should bo revised. They do not now af\nford sufficient safeguards against criminal neg\nlect.\ni; AMBLERS A.

Probably it Is only un\ncommon rascals whose freedom from just pun\nishment ho would seek to secure.\nThirty thousand dollars la a pretty large fee\nfor getting dismissed without trial an indict\nment for simply keeping a gambling house.\nPerhaps it Is based on the theory that the gains\nof the gambler are ill gotten, and that it is only\nfair that ho should divide the swag with the\nlawyer who can keep him going. Anyhow, a\ngambler cannot expect that a lawyer of high\nreputation, one who has been a candidate for\nGovernor, will let himself bo mixed up In low\nassociations without plenty of soap with which\nto wash off the taint afterward. Besides. Mr.\nCautleld can take comfort in the fact that he\ncan soon recoup himself from the gilded *p<\u00bbrts\nwho have money to burn and nro not *atlstled\nunless he takes it from them. Mr. HtanchfleM\nalso. If he stops to think Whether It was worth\n$30,0<X> to keep a gambler out of Jail, may l<e\nsatisfied by the thought that $30,000 Is \"easy\nmoney\" for Mr. ('anhVlri.\nThere an; persons who will think It beneath\nthe dignity of a man like Mr. StSUKhfleld, and\nunworthy of the position which he holds in the\ncommunity, to undertake the defence of the\nmost notorious gambler In America against the\nefforts of the authorities to drive him out of\nbusiness. Those person**, however, do not un\nderstand law as she is practised or appreciate\nthe ethics of the bar which make it bight?\nmoral in an eminent lawyer to defend the mean\nest rascal\u2014 if he has money enough.

Men who arc not yet willing to be con\nsidered <>id remember when Japan was scarcely\nopen to the world, and had scarcely begun to\nemerge from barbarism\u2014 the world gen\nerally spoke of Japan much as of P.unnah ami\nZanzibar and the Fiji Islands. lien still young\nremember when Japan threw off the fetters\nof modht'valisin Und adopted a constitutional\nand representative government. It seems only\nthe other day that extra-terrltorialism was\nabolished, and all other discriminations, and\nJapan was treated as the legal peer of other\nnations. It was two years ago this month that\nGreat Britain took the unprecedented step of\nmaking a treaty of alliance with Japan, treat\ning the latter with a respect and esteem similar\nto that which France pays to Roosta in the\nDual League or lint which the members of the\nTriple Alliance pay to each other.\nTo-day, then. Japan stands unchallenged\namong the great powers Of Hie world. She Is\nthe peer of any of them in legal standing. In\nsentiment and sympathy she actually outranks\nat least one of them. There can, we think, lie\nno doubt thai the preponderance of sympathy\nthe -world over is with her and against her ad\nversary in the present quarrel. That is to say,\nEurope and America side with nn Asiatic power\nof the yellow race against a. Puiopean power\nlargely of the white race. That Is an extraor\ndinary state of affairs, bat the reason is not dif\nficult to discover, it is partly because Japan\nIs seen to be. fighting the battle of civilization\nand progress. She is contending for the Inter\nests of Europe and America, against Influences\nthat would Impair them. Bat that is not all.\nJapan Is also seen to be worthy of the esteem\nshe is receiving. That is perhaps the dominant\nfeature of the case. In wise statesmanship, lv\nshrewd diplomacy, in generous spirit, In earnest\ndesire for peace with justice and honor, and in\nIntelligent self-control Japan has won the ad\nmiration of the world. It Is to be doubted if\nany attar nation In similar circumstances has\never acted more creditably^\nIn the face of. such conditions the old cry of\ntho \"yellow peril\" rings false. It is still raised,\nof course, by Japan*! adversary and would-be\noppressor, and by a few others who formerly\n!\u00bbo committed themselves to it that they cannot\nnow help repeating it. But It Is vain. The\n\u25a0whole influenix- of Japan, both in herself and\nIn respect to China and the other \"yellow\" peo\nples, is so beneficent that other nations are in\nclined to \u00ab>ay, \"If ihis be 'peril,\" let us have more\nof it!\" Moreover, with vhe examples of Poland,\nof Finland and of Armenia before it, and with\nthe threat to male another Finland of the\nwhole Scandinavian Peninsula nnd another Po\nls::: p\" rfc\u00ab Pn\":rti! ; ft* -rorld hi beginning to\nask If the Slavic peril is not greater than the\n\u25a0'yellow\" one. The necessity of such a choice is\nnot to be considered; yet if it were to be, there\nare plenty of judicious thinkers who would pre\nfer to see China controlled and wakened and\nroused to action by Japan rather than by Russia.\nIt may be that neither would be a menace to the\nworld. It seems certain that the former would\nbe the more auspicious for progress and civiliza\ntion.\nPresident Roosevelt urges Congress to take\naction for the preservation of the big trees.\nThis is a century of big: things, and surely the\nEiffel towers of the California groves ought not\nto be neglected.\nThe bill at Albany providing a pension for a\nLong Island policeman who was shot and made\nblind in the faithful performance of his duty\nwhen he tried to arrest a criminal may com\nmend itself to the approval of our legislators.\nThis is a deserving Instance of the desirability\nof special legislation.\nWhat will the poor typesetter do when the le\ngions of General Takaharakamaharahara begin\nto encounter those of General Phootemoffsky\nklllemoffaroff?\nPrizes for aeronautic performances will be\ngiven by the manager of a universal exposition\nto b\u00ab held In Liege In 1905.

There is a momentary pause favorable\nfor peace negotiations, and the tone of the\nCzar's address to the Japanese Ambassador is\ndistinctly reassuring. The optimism bated on\nthe slight signs of improvement may be iilu\n\u25a0lve. for both Japan and Russia may be waft\ning time in diplomacy in order to reinforce gar\nrisons and fleets and purchase all the war mate\nrial in sight. The pessimists take this view,\nbut cannot deny that the Foreign oiflces of\nPrance and England are laboring in the inter\nest* of peace, that Japan has refrained from\n\u25a0ending an ultimatum, that the tone of the\nRussian press is less warlike, and that the Chi\nnese government, by opining- three ports to\nforeign fraae, sW&Uirr made- her influence\nfelt on the right side. Secretary Hay's ef\nfective championship of the \"open door\" prin\nciple has never received sufficient recognition\nIn England, but the newspapers are impressed\n1 v it this week, when they find Viscount\nHayas-hl associating himself with it, and an\nnouncing that the Washington agreement in\nvolves the maintenance of Chinese sovereignty\nand administration in Manchuria. While Eng\nlishmen have fancied that a checkmate for Rus\nsia, could only be placed it! Downing Street, one\nof th* strongest moves in the game has been\nmade by the American pawn. The United States\"\nhas lent n.oral support to Japan by securing\nher admission to the privileges and immunities\ngranted by the Chinese government in Man\nchurlan ports opened to foreign trade, and Rus\nsian acquiescence has quickly followed the exe\ncution of the agreement.\nThe rumors raspsjettasj the determination of\nRussia to violate treaty engagements and send\ntroopships from the Black Sea through the\nDardanelles are interesting, if premature. The\nIndifference of Germany is plainly expressed by\nthe Berlin press.

Th*\npassage of the Dardanelles, by the conven\ntion of j^Tl, is a question which Is determined\nby th?

Jan. 16.\u2014 Just how lars?\u00ab! a bureau tot\nthe dissemination of the Parker literature is\nwording !n Albany at the present moment Is a\nsubject of more than passing interest in this\ncity. Of course ex-Senator David B. Hill is in\nhimself no Inconsiderable bareau, and he '.a\nworking all the time, as is his custom, following\nhis own silent, unobtrusive methods. Then, ex-\nLieutenant Governor William F. Sheehan Is\n\u00fcbiquitous. Only last Thursday Judge Parker\nhad a consultation with these political leaders\nat Wolferfs Roost.\nJust at present there is a well circulated,\nrutror that, In addition to the foregoins;, N. O.\nFanning, a New- York newspaper rr.an. Is en\ngaged on a missionary tour In the West. It\nseems that the Parker people are somewhat\ndisturbed by the fact that the first comment\nthey meet with when they suggest their candi\ndate is, \"Who is Parker?\" To answer that ques\ntion in the pointed ani concise manner of tha\ntrained newspaper man is, it has been earnest\nly affirmed here, the purpose of Mr. Fannins/a\nWestern trip.\nOne thin? is certain, and that is thai wtthia ....\na brief time Mr. Fanning has been seen at the.\nlocal hotel where Chief Jud;?e Parker lives while\nin this city, engaged in earnest conversation\nwith him. On the other hand, the fact is not\nunknown that Mr. Fanning- even In the last\nfew months has given evidence of taking so keen\nan interest in other political matters of the\nDemocratic stripe as to desire to be present and\na part of the inner workings.\nThe declarations of a Tammany Senator on;\nthe subject of the attitude of Tammany and th\u00ab\nsuspicion with which Parker's friendship for\nex-Senator Hill was viewed in the \"Wigwam.\nprinted in Thursday's Tribune, have caused no\nlittle comment and some extremely ingenious ex\nplanations nn the parr of the Chief Judge's\nfriends. They declare eagerly that it la only the\neffort of Tammany to make people think they\nare against Parker, because they realize that\nthe Democrats will not accept any man of Mur\nphy's organization. The leLthanded compliment\nfor Tammany, on whoso votes Judge Parker has)\nto depend to an this State, if he can carry it\nat all, is worthy of notice, and has not escaped\nthe comment of Tammany people themselves. ;\nThere is in all this a certain element of hu\nmor that the Republican leaders here have not\nfailed to appreciate, chief Judge Parker, ac\ncording to the frank declaration of the Tam\nmany Senator, quoted recently in The Tribune,\nmust break away from ex-Senator Hill, because\nthe country is host:!* to KilL On the other\nhand, on the assurance of Judge Parker's\nfriends. there is no hope of his nomination un\nless Tamn-.any makes a decent appearance, at\nleast, of opposing him.\n\u2022Where, then, is Parker?\" inquired a well\nknown Republican legislator to-day. \"What a\njoyful task Mr. Fanning has before him In the\nWest, in explaining how JwhjS Parker is re\nmoved from both Hill and Tammany just\nenough to be desirable as a candidate and yet\nnot enough to be in danger of the fraternal\nDemocratic knifing system!

E. Bates, pay\nmaster general, us not Justified by military prece\ndent if the action was to be construed us a reward\nof that officer, who was graduated from West Point\nafter the \u00ab lv ii War. The promotion, however, \u00bbaa\ncommended for the opportunity It gave for the \u00abd\nvancement Of Colonel F. B. Dodge, an oillcer of\nCroat distinction and military activity. There was\nalso boom criticism of General O. L,. Oillespie.\nwbose promotion to major general caused the ap\npointment aa chief engineers of Colonel Alexander\nMackenzie, one of the ablest officers of the army.\n11 .\u25a0\u2022 a notable feature of these nominations thut\nColonel Mackensie was not a candidate for pron-.0\ntton. having replied to the tempting proposition of\nadvancement over tho beads of three colonel* that\nhe would not seek the place. The decision to make\nhim chief, of engineers was reached while Mackenzie\nwas on an official trip to Hawaii. Line officers think\nthat the place of major general and the billet of\nassistant chief of staff should have: been reserved\nfor a lino colonel or a genera] officer, and not tilled\nby transfer of the chief of a staff corps.\nTho appointnu nt of Colonel J. V. Story to bo\nchief of artillery elves pleasure to Cat officer's\nfriends because be really takes his old place m\nrelation to the two colonels he now jumps. When\nStory was graduated from West Point his class\nmates were Colonels Charles Morris and a. M.\nMills, who have been senior to him In the artil\nlery corps. At the time of the graduation, in 1*67,\nthey stood relatively Story. Mills ana .Morris. la\nthe days of regimental promotion the order was\nChanged so that on the consolidation of the artil\nlery arm into a corps those class associate* stood\nwith Morris first. Mill* second and Story third.\nHis appointment to be brigadier general and to the\nplace of chief of artillery Is consequently accepted\nas an Instance where an officer Injured by the in\nequalities of regimental promotion comes Into his\nP Bome criticism was also made of the appoint\nment of Colonel A. L. Milla as a brigadier general.\n'mat officer Is colon, l only by virtue of being BO\nperintendent of the Military Academy, to which\nduty ho wan assigned while a first lieutenant of\ncavalry on account of exceptional^ urllllunt ser\nvice In Cuba. Some diligent gtatlstlclan In the War\nDepartment has discovered that Mills practically\ntakes precedence over b3O officers whose names are\nahead of his on the relative rrink list. Much specu\nlation was heard to-day regarding the future duty\nof Colonel Mills. The Impression prevails that ha\nwill continue as superintendent of the Military\nAcademy, where be ha.- been a most useful otliciai.\nUnder his administration the Institution has been\nextremely prosperous. The fact that m recent years\nth- West Point super intendency was considered a\nproper billet for a lieutenant colonel or colonel la\nnot now considered to prevent continuing Co.onel\nMills there as a brigadier general.\nIt was expected that one of the appointments to\nthe 'place of biljrudier general would be that or\nColonel B.

The latter has. however,\nrefused to ko on the retired list, and Crowder was\nnot promoted.

A.\nI\nCAUGHT IX FURIOUS STORM.\nThe vessel was a regular dally passenger\nPacket. She made moderately good progress\nacross the Straits, bound for Victoria, until\nTrial Island, off the entrance to the harbor, was\nabeam. Then a terrific cross sea was pelting\nthe vessel, retarding her progress and making \\\nlife uncomfortable for those aboard. Little fear j\nwas manifested, however, until word came up j\nfrom below that the vessel was leaking. Inves- '\ntigation showed that the waves on the wind- '.\nward side had stove In a deadlight, through j\nwhich the water rushed in volumes, resisting all\neffort* to stop it.\nSeeing the efforts futile, the safety at the\npassengers particularly the women and chil- j\ndren, was looked after, and all \"bo desired were '\nX Off fron\u00ab the M*\u00abmer In the boats. The '\nheavily laden boats were thrown about wildly In \\\nthe choppy sea. and one after another, after i\nsucceeding in getting away from the vessel. '\nwere either capsized or swamped.\nALL WOMEN AND CHILDREN\" LOST.\nThe terrible fury of the storm is attested by\nthe fart that not a woman or child of nil thos\u00bb '\non board lived to tell th* tale. An apparent di\u00df- !\nercnaney in numbers from the list of fatalities \\\nis accounted for by the fact that only the chil- j\ndren who paid half fare were on the passenger i\nlist.\nIn the mean time word had come from Vie- '\ntoria of the vessel's predicament. and powerful ;\ntugs were dispatched to render assistance. The j\nRichard Holyoke. in command of Captain Rob- i\ncrt Hall, was the urst to reach the Clallam. I\nwhich had by this time careened partly over '\nfrom the inrush of water, which had put the !\nengines out of commission. The Holyoke\nreached the Clallam about 11 o'clock last night !\nand about 1 a. m. succeeding In getting a !\nhawser aboard, with which she started to tow !\nthe Clallam to safety. The dsJlam took a heavy j\nlurch, ar.l those remaining aboard were com- !\npelled to climb up the side to safety, finally i\nreaching the roof of the pilot house.\nSURVIVORS RESCUED BY TUG'S BOATS.\nWithout a moment's hesitation the tug's boats\nwere lowered and the work of rescue began At\nthis point the tug Sea Lion. Captain Hunter\narrive.d. and her mm rendered valuable as\nsistance. Before all the struggling people had\nbeen taken off the riallam began to break up\nand soon afterward went down. All possible\nassistance to the rescued people was given by\nthe two shipmasters and their crews and the i\ntugs hurried to Port Townsend. The surviving i\npassengers and the remainder of the crew then '\ntook passage on the Dirigo. bound for Seattle\nSTORY OF A SURVIVOR.\nW. H. Grimes, of Redmond, Wash . aboard the\nClallam, bound for Victoria, gives a conciao I\nstatement. \"The weather was. pretty rough. \" he i\nsaid, \"but we- had no suspicion of danger until :\nMOM one forward said something about life pre\nservers. I went forward to Investigate, and\nthere learned that the Clallam was making\nwater rapidly.

Jan. 9.-The action of the Board of\nAssessors of New-York City in greatly increas\ning the assessed valuation of real estate in that\nmunicipality will materially affect the amount\n| of special franchise taxes that corporations\noperating in that city will be required to pay\n; ur.der the Ford law. It is probable that their\n, assessments will be increased about one-third\nI Of course, this is dependent on a decision of\nj the United States Supreme Coi-rt sustaining the\nI decision of the Court of Appeals of this state.\n; which held the Franchise Tax law to be con\nstitutional.\nIn the equalization of the valuation of real\n, estate in this State among the several counties\nI the State Board of Equalization has rated the\nvaluation for New-York City at \u2022\" per cent\nthat is, it has held that the local assessors val\nued that class of property at 67 per cent of its\nactual or market value, in 1\u00abNT8 the local as\nsessors of New- York increased the total value\nof real estate from IU3&MT.IR9 to 91181..\nf-r0.826. an increase of 51.4:.H9\u00bb\u00bb3,247. or about\none-third.\nThe Special Franchise Tax law provides that\n! the value of the special franchises shall be\nj fixed by the State Board of Tax Commissioners\nj at \"full value.- The courts, in construing the\n! law. decided that the assessment should be at\nthe rate at which other classes of real estate\nare assessed in the same locality. Under that\ni decision the assessments placed on franchises\noperated in New-York City will be reduced\nabout one-thin!.\nWhen the State Board of Equalization pre\npares Its next equalization table the rate for\nNew- York City 'will be increased in consequence\nof the Increased valuation made by the assessors\nof that city. It Is estimated that the next equal\nization table will rate New-York at 75 instead\nof 67 per cent. Thus, in the readjustment of\nspecial franchise tax valuations in that city In\nthe future the reduction will be about 25 in\nstead of 33 per cent.\nIt is learned here to-day that the corporations\nof New- York City which are parties to the liti\n| gation attacking the special franchise tax act in\nj the Federal Supreme Court are practically tha\ni enly large corporations which have not yet paid\ntheir taxes under the law. The amount of\nI money due from these corporations Is estimated\nat between $ln.<iOn.<iiNj and SI'J.OOO.OOO. The\nexact figures cannot be ascertained, because the\nj amount due depends not only on the assessment\nj made, but also on reductions to be made under\ni the Court of Appeals decision and the additions\nI for Interest. In most up-State counties the cor\nj porations and the assessors have gone into court\nj and secured orders adjusting the assessments\ni pursuant to the Court of Appeals decision. It Is\n; impossible to obtain a record of the corporations\n| which have paid their tax, or the amounts paid\nj because that is a transaction local to th\u00ab taa\nj district In which each franchise operates, th\u00ab\n\u25a0 duties of the State Tax Commissioners ceasing\ni when they have valued the franchises.\nFLEE FROM MOUNTAIN,\nSugar Loaf, in Kentucky, GnmJt\nand Pours Forth Smoke.\nOwingsville.

Two Southern States\n-lann and Mississippi\u2014 have expressed\nthdr legislatures their hearty approval\ncf ttbt cana! convention. Tbe Louisiana Legis\nlature, by a unanimous vote in each branch,\ninstructed Senators M>Enery and Foster to\nwtpport the treaty. The Mississippi Legislature,\nby large majorities in each house, passed a\nresolution \"requesting\" Senators Money and\nMcLaurin to vote for ratification. In other\nStates, whose legislatures are not in seisiosi,\npopular pressure in behalf of ratification has\nbeen brought through boards of trad* and other\nrommercla! bodies. Texas is represented by\ntwo Senators who have declared, in response to\nappeals from non -political organizations, that\nthey will follow their own Ideas and defeat\nraMfl^atlun. if they can, no matter what their\nronsrituenta think or wish. Tbe Mississippi\nand Louisiana Senators have not publicly com\nmitted themselves. But talk is beard to the\n\u2022fleet that Messrs. Money aud McLaurin may\nfinally decide to ignore) the Mississippi Legis\nlature's \"request* \u2022\nBow far instructions to United Stntes Sen\nator* aboald be honored is, of course, a prob\nlem quite Incapable of tettlement. Our \"un\n\"rrftten constitution\" furnishes no hard-and\nfast rul<\\ Precedents conflict and a Senator U\nleft by custom to obey or ignore the wishes of\nh's State Legislature as bis own sense of ex\nftwdfeory or obligation may dictate. The South\nern strict-construction. State's rtjruts school,\nwhich considered each Senator the ambassador\n\u2022f a sovereign power, adopted tbe rijfld view\nof his ambassadorial ohlljrntlon. John Tyler,\nu. logical exponeut of that doctrine, resigned his\nsaat when t!io Virginia Leglslnture instructed\nhim to vot*. to expunge the famous resolution\n<.r oonsuro dlro<:ed at President Jackson. But\nJew men In public life have pone to that ex\ntrtme. Many Senators have necer-ted in\u00abtmc\ntlon\u00ab mid exefTited them.

He even\nwent further and laid down this general prin\nciple: \"I do not exercise my Senatorial duties\n\"fcubject to leidslative supervision, ror hold\n\"my place at the legis.'ativo will. ' Yet another\nSenator\u2014 Mr. Perkins, of California\u2014 voted at\nthe succeeding session to ratify the treaty of\npen-\" witli Spain against bis personal judg\nment and in deference to au expression of\nopinion from the legislature of California.\nIt ennnot be held that there is any com\npulsion in a resolution of msiructions. But\nthe wise statesman will defer to it when he\ncan, and defy it only when he must and in\ndefying it he \\n required to plant himself on\ntomr- solid ground of logic or of morals. A\nconvincing demonstration of lofty purpose Is\noertninJy the least that can be expected of the\nSenators from Mississippi and Louisi.ina. If\nthey refuse to co-operate In an undertaking\nv.-hlch the?r constituencies hare so deeply and\nearnestly fit heart.\nTEE EDUCATIONAL SCBZME.\nThe educational establishment bill ou wh!eh\nleading members of the Senate and Assembly\nare said to have agreed, and widen is supposed\nto embody the filial views of the joint legis\nlative committee and to have received the Got\nernor's approval, may not pass fo easily as\nsome of its advocates expect. It might. In\nfact, be a risky proceeding to push through In\na hurry, as (hero is talk of doing, a measure\nof the Bret Importance relating to a matter us\nto which there baa been a wide divergence of\nofficial aad general opinion for years and until\nwithin a few days. We hope that most of\nthose who have engaged iu the long contro\nversy will be ready t.\u00bb admit that tnc proposed\nscheme has some excellent features. If enact\ned and carried out lu good faith. It would\neventually accomplish h veritable unification\nof school control, which has always been the\nearnest desire of Intelligent and disinterested\ncitizens of this State. But it appear? to us that\nin Its present form them may be o'ojectlona\nwhica require careful consideration. Possibly\nthey wauld prove less formidable than they\nnow look. Perhaps It might l\u00bbc found that an\nattempt to change the scheme materially would\narouse fatal opi\u00bbosition to any plan for getting\nrid of existing evils. In which case it would be\njudicious to weigh the comparative advantages\nof keeping on in the old way or of adopting a\nnew way also faulty. At all events, Impartial\ndiscussion, inspired by a conscientious purp\nto do the best thing for the State, ou^'bt to\nprecede legislative action.\nThe opinion is held by s>ome lawyers of repute\nthat Kegeuts of the University, elected for life\nIn conformity with the statute, cannot be con\nstitutionally ejected from office at tbe pleasure\nof the legislature. If that question should bo\nformally raised by any of the Regents, or by\nanybody else, for that matter, tho*e who like to\nmake trouble under a pretence of helpfulness\nwould infallibly repeat the shabby misrepre\nsentation that such Regeuts are selfishly re\nsolved to keep their places at all hazards. The\nfact is that few of the Regents would person\nally object to being lawfully relieved of the\nunsolicited duties which were Imposed upon\nthem by the legislature and whiih they huve\nperformed to the best of their ability at con\nsiderable sacrifice. Still, the question of con\nstitutionality ought to be intelligently consid\nered In advance, Instead of being left to pro\nduce, perhaps, serious embarrassment here\nafter.\nThere is another important consideration re\nlating to the Intrinsic merits of the plan pro\nposed. The ostensible desire of all who have\njoined in the educational dispute has been to\ntake and keep politics out of tbe schools. But\na moment's reflection suggests the Inquiry, per\ntinently raised In our Albany correspondence\nyesterday, \"whether the election of an entirely\n\"new board by the present legislature, and the\n\"selection of an entirely new superintendent by\n\"the present legislature, and the organization\n\"of an entirely new 6ystem under the present\n\"legislature, do not seem to put the whole\n\"school system of the State, secondary edui-a\n\u2022tlon as well as primary, more completely in\n\"the hands of the politicians than ever.\" Un\ndoubtedly, fortunate results under such an ar\nrangement are attainable, and we hope that\nits sponsors are resolved to secure them. If a\nman fully qualified in all respects for the new\ncommissionershlp of education should receive\nand accept tbe appointment there might be\nnothing to regret But if tbe legislature, either\nowing to unforeseen complications or by pre\nvious contrivance, should be compelled or per\nsuaded to fall back on an unsuitable candidate\nthe fixed condition of things for six years to\ncome might easily be as bad as anything\nknown hitherto. As for the apportionment of\nthe Regents among the Judicial districts of the\nState, though its natural tendency would be to\nincrease rather than diminish the danger of p>\nlitical interference in their selection, still. It\nis manifestly desirable on some accounts that\nthe board should fairly represent the various\nparts of the commonwealth.\nFor obvious reasons. Tbe Tribune Is reluctant\nto find fault with a plan of school administra\ntion which contains a promise of unification\nunder a competent directing body aud of\npermanent relief from the distracting con\ntroversy which it has earnestly endeavored\nto help compose in the only rational manner.\nWe gladly acknowledge the good features of\nthis latest measure, but we know that it ought\nto be dealt with deliberately, and our impres\nsion is that it may need to be amended in some\nparticulars.\n.A.V IXSPIRIXO EXAMPLE.\nBy the elow removal of dead bodies from the\nHarwick mine the public is etill forced to con\ntemplate the tragedy enacted there early In\nthe week. There is one phase of the unfortu\nnate business, though, on which the mind can\ndwell with pleasure and protit. Even yet, per\nhaps, enough attention has not been directed\nthereto. In the beautiful heroism of those wbo\nbought to rescue the Imprisoned miners there\nis inspiration for the dullest soul. No one\nknew better than McCann. Taylor, Lysle and\ntheir associates the risks they ran. They were\nonly too familiar with tbe consequences of\npast explosions. \"Afterdamp\" unquestionably\nmeant more to them than to mos: people, but\nthey dreaded Its effects upon others rather\nthan upon themselves. Tbe one thought which\noccupied their minds was the desolation with\nwhich nearly two hundred homes were threat\nened. In an attempt to reduce this to the\nlowest possible minimum they were willing to\nimperil, and even sacrifice, their lives. Tbe\nworld cannot honor such a spirit too much.\nIf it had been practicable to witness what\nhappened Inside the mine immediately after\nthe explosion. It is pomtble that one might\nhave been privileged to look upon equally noble,\nif ab%-\u00bblutely futile, efforts. Though It Is an\nestablished fact that about one-half of the\ncolliery disasters on record are the result of\ntbe carelessness of the miners, it Is also true\nthat this weakness is characteristic of only a\nfew, not of the many. It is known that a con\nrideraole proportion cf the men employed In\ncoal mine*, especially of those of American\nMrth. show nm<-h consideration for their fel\nlows and assistants. Roberts. In his book on\nthe anthracite industry, furnishes numerous\nIllustrations of that iralt.

JANtJABY 20. 1004\nin the Harwick mine were killed instantly anil\nhow many remained conscious for an hour or\nmore nobody cau tell. It is not at all im\nprobable, though, that the Kfenes described by\nHuberts were repeated or paralleled on this\noccasion. Humanity nnd courage are widely\ndistributed In all trades and professions. They\nanimate tbe millionaire engineer and the\nhumb^t workman.\nA LESSOX ON IRRESPOXSIBILITY.\nWe hope that District Attorney Jerome will\nnot fail to notice the account of tbe remark of\nPatrolman Datton before Magistrate Ommea\nwhen he was reprimanded for clubbing a pris\noner: \"Didn't Jerome s;iy out In Chicago that\nwe were to Ix-at our iidsouers?\" It ought to\nluipre6a on Mr. Jerome*! miud the evil of reck\nless and Irresponsible utterance, especially on\nthe part of n man in official position. We have\nnevrr sopposed tor a moment that Mr. Jerome\nrcnlly meant to advocate \u25a0 carnival of bead*\nbreaking on the part of the police either in\nNew-York or Chicago, aud we advised our\nChicago friends not to miud, when they got\nexcited about his Incitement of their peace\norticcrs to violence. We told them it was jnst\na way Mr. Jerome had of overstating himself.\nNevertheless, if Mr. Jerome's remarks had any\neffect at all, it wad Inevitable that they should\nbe In the direction of lawlessness, and It is\nnow apparent that they did have that effect.\nOne swallow does not make a summer, and\nthe excuse of one putrolnian is not to be taken\nas evidence that the whole force is going to\njro clubbing In conscious accord with Mr.\nJerome's advice. Dalton's remark, however,\nindicates that the District Attorney's words\nhave been taken account of by the police. They\nmny not, tbey probably do not, prompt delib\nerate brutality, but tlipy come to mind as a\nready excuse for brutality Indulged in under\nsome other provocation. To that extent they\nnre demoralizing. They weaken self-control.\nThey also tend to diminish the respect which\npolicemen should entertain for the District\nAttorney as a representative of the dignity and\nsanctity of law. It must be distinctly humiliat\ning to him and unfortunate for tbe community\nthiit his 111-considered talk should come as\ncurrent coin of excuse to a polleeman rebuked\nfor brutal and disorderly conduct It would\nhave been natural In Devery's time to expect\nn pntrolman to quote the \"bip chief* as an\nauthority for some outrageous conduct, but we\nhnrdly expect Mr. Jerome's table talk to serve\ngoca purposes.\nBRIDGE STAGES.\nAn enterprising person with some scrawny\nnags on their way to the boneyard baa attempt\ned to start an omnibus Hue across the Will\niamsburg Bridge. He did not secure liberal\npatronftfji because possible patrons were de\nterred by the humane fear of adding to the\nbttrden of his steeds, and after a few trips the\npolice put I stop to liis activities o^ing to his\nlack of a license. Thus this attempt to aeoin\nmodate the public came to a timely end. It\nfailed because It was founded on no proper\npreparation to meet the reasonable demands\nof the situation. There Is, however, no good\nreason why the WlHiamsburc Kridpe should\nuot be made Immediately useful by a decently\nequipped stase line. There nre plenty <\u00bbf\nberata In the city, fully ah\\^ to drag an om\nnibus over the bridge at good speed, with ea*\u00ab\nfor th>>m themselves nnd with comfort for their\npassengers. Why Fliould the work be loft to\nsomebody with only scarecrows for motive\npower?\nIt Is not to be supposed for an Instant that\nthe authorities would refuse permission tor\nthe running of proi>erly equipped stages over\nthe brldjre If a license were sought from them\non reasonable terms by trustworthy pers us\nSome of the automobile rnmnantaa which nre\ntrying to popularize heavy vehicles like truck!\"\nand stapes might find It profitable to demon\nstrata the capabilities of their inventions by\nrunning them on the bridge. If there wero\nroom enough after the cars were running, it\nmight not be a bad thing to have such a line\npermanently, perhaps allowing Its managers to\ncharge 10 cents fare for extra accommoda\ntions. That would enable women compelled to\ncross the bridge at tbe rush hour to enrnpe un\npleasant crowding. Temporarily, at any rate,\na line of automobiles would be useful, and\nought to be profitable, particularly as the ve\nhicles could probably be used for other pur\nposes afterward.\nJAP AXD RVSB.\nComparisons, or contrasts, between Japan\nand Itusslii are striking, in more than one re\nepect. Thus Japau has about 47.000.0U0 people\nand Russia perhaps 130,000.000. Again. Japan's\nland area Is scarcely 1>\u00ab3.000 square miles,\nwhile Russia's Is nearly 8,700,000. 8o Russia\nhas nearly three times as many people and\nmore than fifty times as much hind as Japan.\n(Wherefore, we might think. Russia might\nwell afford to bo a little less land hungry at\nJapan's expense.)\nOn the other hand, Japnn, with her so much\nsmaller population, has more pupils in her\nschools than Russia. According to the latest\navailable statistics, Japan has 4.302.G23 chil\ndren in elementary schools, and Russia only\n4.103.594. That Is to say, ninety-one in every\nthousand Japanese and only thirty-two in\nevery thousand Russians are in elementary\nschools. The disproportion of numbers in sec\nondary schools and universities Is equally\nmarked, In favor of Japan.\nAgain. Japan has 4.80^ postofflces. or one to\nevery 9,700 people, while Russia has only 6.029,\nor one to every 21.500 people. Japan has. under\nsail and steam, a commercial marine of 734,413\ntons, while Russia has only 633.822 tons.\nJapan's purchases from the United States\namount to about $21,000,000 a year, and Rus\nsia's to only $17,000,000.\nOf course. It Is argued that Russia is still in\nan elemeutary 6ta;\u00ab of development. Rut\nRussia lias been in full and direct Intercourse\nwith the civilized world 6lnce the time of Peter\nthe Great, two hundred years ago. while Japan\nhas been in a similar state scarcely fifty years.\nThat is to say, Japan has made three times\nthe progress Russia has. and In one-fourth the\ntime. In such circumstances, It Is not at all\nstrange that the admiration and sympathy of\nthe world are given to Japan in a great\nmeasure.\nPISTOLS IN POCKETS.\nIn the trial of Callohan in the Court of Gen\nera! Sessions before Judge McMahon, upon a\ncharge of killing Irving, both men having been\nmembers of East Side trr.opa of ruffians, a great\ndeal of testimony was taken as to the carryin\nof deadly weapons by lawbreakers.\nIt is evidently time that stern repressive meas\nures be adopted against carrying pistols in the\npocket How much shooting In the streets is\nthere in London or other European cities?\nThere in too much of it among the murderous\ngangs in the moat degraded districts of New-\nYork.

Jan. 10.\u2014 Secretary Hay yester\nday sent another communication to General\nIlafael Reyes, the Colombian Envoy, in response\nto his protest against the action of the United\nStates regarding affairs on the Isthmus of Pan\nama. While State Department officials decline\nto make any specific statement as to its nature.\nIt is understood that, In a general way, it fol\nlows the lines laid down In the reply to Oeneral\nRwyes's first note, which practically declined to\nreopen the Panama question, and also follows\ntho recent message of the President to Congress\non the Panama question. Justifying the step*\ntaken by the United States government.\nThe reply does not discuss one matter which\nGeneral Reyes urged In his second note, the\ntransmission to the Senate of the correspondence\nbetween himself and the State Department. It\nis known that the officials of the State Depart\nment resented the suggestion of General Reyes\nas highly improper, and for this reason the an\nswer does not discuss this request.

Tha\nsuggestion was made to-night that possibly he\nmight stay and try to open diplomatic relations\nwith Panama, through its representative here,\nfor the adjustment of such questions as the as\nsumption by Panama of a part of the exterior\ndebt of Colombia.\nSome suggestion also has been made, though\nnot officially, of a reunion of the two govern\nments under the name of the Republic of Co\nlombia, Panama to have an autonomous gov\nernment, with absolute authority to deal with\nall questions relating- to the control of canal\nmatters.\nCOLOMBIAN THOOPS OFF NICARAGUA.\nThree Hundred Land on St. Andrew's Island\n\u2014To Put Down Rebellion, It Is Said.\nWashington, Jan. 10\u2014 A dispatch to the Navy\nDepartment from Rear Admiral CophUn, com\nmanding the American naval forces on the\nCaribbean side of the Isthmus of Panama, says\nthat a Failing vessel which has Just arriv-d at\nColon reports the arrival of three hundred\nColombian troops at St. Andrew's Island.

Jan. 10.\u2014 An authority c-nversant\nwith Russia's position In the Far East, and her\nattitude toward American interests, made to-day\nthe following statement:\n\"In view of the wide circulation given reports\nwithout basis In fact, chargins Russia with hos\ntility to American Interests in the Far East, it\nseems expedient that the attitude of Russia should\nbe again defined.\n\"Russia has repeatedly expressed her Intention\nof assisting tha development of commercial Inter\nests In Manchuria, knowing that the Chinese\npolicy of the United States government Is guided\nmerely by an aim to djvelop tride and not by\npolitical ambition. Russia has shown her good faith\nby refraining from any action which would en\ndanger the eonclu3lon of the American-Chinese\ncommercial treaty signed on October S. That\ntreaty has been ratified by the throne at F\nand thus, through the medium of tha United States,\nthe important ports of Moukden and Antung. in\nManchuria, are opened to the commerce of the\nworld. This is the 'open door\" which ha* been a\npart of American and Russian policy since the\nBoxer outrages, which necessitated the Interven\ntion of the powers, and which materially changed\nconditions in Manchuria.\n\"Russia will certainly not submit to dictaaon at\nthe hands of any power as to the protection of her\nlegitimate Interest in Manchuria. Negotiations ara\nIn progress between St. Petersburg and Peking Ln\nthe effort to reach an agreement adequately pro\ntecting the special or predominant Inrtuence exer\ncised by Russia in Manchuria, and which has been\nrecognized by all the powers signatory to the peace\nprotocol verbally or In writing.\n\"At tha time ci the signing of that convention It\nwaa Russia's hope that she could with safety with\ndraw her forces from Manchuria last October, and\nleave the protection ut her interests to China, In\n'ho nitiii time, however, it. was clearly demon\nstrated that the guarantees offered by China were\nwholly Insufficient, and it became necessary for tr.e\nRussian government to ask for additional guar\nantees. Until these have been arranged for tha\nRussian go\\ernment cannot be expected to with\ndraw from Manchuria, and thus menace the many\nRussian livea and forfeit the $2.50,\u00bbA000 which haa\n1.-een spent there in the civilization and development\nof that province.\n\"Russia Is ready and anxious to stimulate the de\nvelopment of foreign commerce in Manchuria. The\ngrowth of trade means the success of the Siberian\nrailway. Russia believes, however, that this com\nmercial development is possiole without the estab\nlishment of spheres of political influence irx ih\u00ab\nopen ports. Russia's political influence in this ter\nritory, which lies in her borders, is and must 04\nconsidered predominant, and its effectiveness would\nbe lmpairea by the creation of any form of foreign\npolitical Influence in the shape of extra-territorial\ngovernment or municipal control and regulation of\ncertain districts within thaae open ports similar to\nconditions such as. for example, exist at Shanghai.\nBut no trouble Is anticipated on this score, aj th\u00ab\nAmerican-Chinese commercial .treaty, providing for\nthe setting aside of certain districts in Moukcien\nand Antung -b places of international residence\nand trade, and the provision for their regulation, is\nnot considered aa tending toward the establishment\nof a system like that surrounding foreign interests\nat Shanghai.\n'\u2022Russia does not propo3\u00ab to discuss tha negotia\ntions now ln progress. B'lt It should be realized\nthat she Is availing herself of \u00bbvery reajonabie\nmeans to reach an agreement by diplomacy.\n\"It will be an Interesting bit of Information to the\nRussian government to know that tha primary ol-\nJect of the Tokio negot'ations. so far as Japan is\ncorcernpd. Is the protection of American ard Ens-\nUsh Interests ln the Far East. Russia had supposed\nthat Japan was influenced by less unselfish mo\ntives.\"\nEDUCATION, JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY.\nThese, Dr. Adler Says.

The\ncondition to-dav In the South Is simtlar to that\nwhich existed during the latter part of the Middle\nAges In Europe, and wh*ch resulted In the French\nRevolution. In old ante-bellum days there were\nonly two classes In our South \u2014 the wealthy whites\nand the poor whltev To-day there has risen a\nprosperous and working middle class, which is\ncoming Into i>ower; and It Is becausa the white\nmen who are worklr.s are beginning to want a\nplac\u00bb and distinction pointed out for themselv\u00ab*\nwhich *hall d^tin(ful?h them from the Inferiors. It\nIs a case of climbing up by pushing some one else\nback.\nWhat are th\u00bb meanire* In which we may trust\nto ameliorate present conditions? First, education\nIs our one great hopeful method. Second, exact\nand equltah!e administration of Justice. Treat tha\nnegro as a grown man. Th^ te-m \"child race\" la\n\u25a0 iwniraui term to use.

That Is not democracy. That is the\nsystem which prevailed In England under\nGeorsre 111 and corrupted government from top\nto bottom.\nThe merit system as administered has defects.\nThere art? incompetent clerks In ollice. It \u25a0will\nbe Interesting to observe, however, where the\nCongressmen who complain over the cost of the\ndepartments on this account will stand when\nefforts are made to reduce by a half hour the\nalready moderate day's work In tho executive\noGlc?s. One of the principal causes of ineffi\nciency is the Congressional habit of getting\naround the merit system. A temporary service\nIs orgudaM by favoritism, and then its clerics\nare covered Into the classified, with all of the\nprotection of the merit system, without having\nundergone the sifting process which makes\nthose who have won in competition worth pro\ntecting. After doing all they can to debauch\nthe system and prevent its giving the public\ngo< d service, it ill becomes the spoilsmen to\nIndulge In virtuous laments over the sufferings\nof the country from the Civil Service law.\nA FOOLISH SCHEME.\nIt is reported that the Assistant Counsel to\nthe Corporation has personally delivered Into\nsafekeeping at Albany a bill which provides\nfor, or permits, the city to Issue ten year bonds\nwherewith to pay for practically unlimited re\npairs to the County Courthouse. The fact that\nMr. Guy Is arranging for the introduction of\ntin; iimwiui justices a belief that the admin\nistration wants to have it passcil and makes a\nword of warning necessary. Tbcie have been\nvarious plans for reconstructing the courthouse\nat groat expense, and one or two of them have\nbeen strongly enough supported to cause some\nanxiety, but they have not commanded public\nfavor. The must ambitious of these schemes\nwas that propo* d by some of the Judges, which\ncalled for an outlay of about $2,0\u00abX>,000, and\nyet was officially acknowledged to be In many\nrespects n\u2014 tiif\u00dfftnrr If Mr. Guy's bill should\nbe ptsnd it is not unlikely that an even larger\nsum would bo demanded. Wo are persuaded\nthat all such ambitious projects nre unwise for\ntwo reasons. In the first place, the courthouse\nis not worth a heavy expenditure. In tho sec\nond [>!\u2022\u00ab\u2022, if the proposition is virtually to\nmake a new buiUlin?: of it, though the plans\nand the Wkmaashlp mi-lit be intrinsically ex\ncellent, the site would still be unsuitable and\nthe result disappointing.\nPresident Ahearn of the Borough of Manhat\ntan took occasion shortly before he succeeded\nMr. Cantor to NMff the proposal that such\npcbll-? buildings a3 the city urgently needs, in\nc!urting a new eonrthocse, should be put up\nbetween the Hall of Records and Broadway.\nXo such lnrgo plan can be carried out rapidly,\nbut Mr. A hear n Is right in declaring that the\ncity should determine to make an extensive\nimprovement of that nature and do the work\ngradually as circumstances permit. The first\nesEP\u00dftial 6t?p is to take possession of the land.\n\u25a0Hi \u00abtir opinion, frequently expressed, is that\nit is foolish to postpone its acquisition. The\nvalue of the property will certainly never be\nless than it is now, and there is every reason\nto believe That It \u2022will steadily Increase. The\nbuildings standing there could bo temporarily\nused to a greater extent than they now are for\nthe transaction of public business, and from\nthe first (ha investment would probably prove\na^vnntageous.\nTnerp Is ranch evidence that these views are\ngenerally shared by intelligent citizens, as they\nare knewn to be by members of the present\nand former administrations, and for this reason\nMr. Guy's bill is not likely to find smooth sail\ning. \\Te are convinced that It ought to <n\nceunter fatal opposition. Undoubtedly, the\ncourthouse is inconvenient and unsanitary. It\nexposes Juflsros. Juries, lawyers, litigants, wit\nnesses and attendants to manifold discomforts\nand dangers, and there Is no reafon to hope\nthat progress with the plan propped by Mr.\nAhearn will 'ne rapid enough to obviate the need\nof Incurring a considerable bill for repairs. But\nreconstruction on an elaborate scale at enor\nmous cost would be a blunder.\nJAPAyS VIEW OP RUSSIA.\nIn making what is said to be a pacific, or nt\nleast non-bttlllgercnt, reply to Russia's latest\nnote concerning the Mandturian-Corean ques\ntion, Japan has. from the Jupanesa print of\nview, acred with much moderation and re\nstraint. For to the .Tapcaeso nrtud the Ru^iun\nproposals were so offensive as to eavor of add\ning insult to injnrv. Tints nil talk aboirt Rus\nclan \"eonetssioni*\" to Japan in Corea, If not In\nManchuria, is regarded by the Japanese as es\nsentially ttcrtertiiirnL They boW that, accord\ning to every valid aril topical principle, the nat\nural rights of Japan there are far superior to\nany Russia mr.y p\u00ab\u00bb\"* 3 - Japan wad fighting\nwnrs with Kubiai Khan over Corea at a time\nwlieu tb\u00ab cLiaf tains of what has since bean do\nveloped Into Russia were making pilgrimages\ninto Asia to kiss a Tarter tyraiu s stirrup in\ntoken of subjection to him. In proximity, In\nmagnitude of Interests, and In all considerable\nret-pect*, Japan *o far outranks Russia that tho\nconcessions and condescension, if any there\nshall be, must be |\u2014 rtHI by Japan to Russia,\nand not by Russia to Japan.\nJapan therefore strongly resents the Russian\nprescriptions that \"Japan must not\" do thus\nand so in Northern Corea. She holds that no\npotrer in the world has a right thus to dictate\nt\u00bb her. This is tke in\u00abre co f-ince Russia at\nthe mine time declares tmat she \"accepts bo\ncosMUtirns\" In reference to Manchuria. Why\nnot, asks Japan, since she assumes so high and\nmighty a tooo concerning Japan In Corea? Why\nmost Japan in Oorea suffer conditions which\nRussia will net toWrara in Manchuria? Surely,\nthey say, J&paa's rights in Corea are far su\nperior to Russia's in Maaciruria. Children in\ntheir play have a Keying intended to denote\nmcncpcJlstic greed. It is: \"What's yours la\nMine, and wliat's mine Is ray own.\" That, in\nthe Japanese viow, is Russia's attitude. She\nclaims as exclusively her own Manchuria, re\nfnsing even to discnis its disposal; and at the\nsame time sac claims the control of Corea,\nwhich properly b^onj^ within Japan's sphere\nof infinencts. In brief, think the Japanese, Rus\nsia arrogates to b\u00abrsoif monopolistic authority\nla tUat part of the world. She insists that she\nnisy do as ai:t> pIeMM without consul tlag any\none else, bet tlmt nobody else shall do anything\nwithout censnltingr her.\nWhether iitk> Japanese view of the Russian\nsrovenuaotK a&d it\u00ab d\u00abaigTii> bo true or false. it\nsoeeis to have same justifltfttira in th\u00bb uttcr\naiyaos of the Russia* press v birb arc approved\nby the Bvsaiaa official ren^at.

But what a discrepancy there is\nbetween that and the other llussiau Etntement,\nthat \"we cannot discuss Manchuria any more\n\"than we could Australia or the Philippines.\n\"Manchuria does not belong to us.\" Thee why\nis Russia's consent necessary for the opening\n'it lianennrian ports?

JANUARY 15. 1904.\nland which Russia does not own any more than\nshe owns Australia? Whether this Japaueso\nway of looking at the subject Is right or wror.p.\nit certainly does suggest Bom\u00ab Interesting re\nflections.\nELECTRICITY ON THE CENTRAL.\nCriticism which was elicited by one feature\nof the electrical programme of the New- York\nCentral Uaiiroad has just received attention\nfrom two well known technical periodicals,\n\"The Electrical World and Engineer\" and \"The\nEngineering Kecord.\" Up to tho present time\nlu-actlailiy all the electric traction work dono\nm tho world has beea performed with a direct\ncurrent. A number of experiments have been\ncoodnctod with the alternating current of late.\nSome of these encourage the hop\u00a9 that this typo\nof current mny eventually prove serviceable,\nbut it can hardly be s:iid that all of the minor\nquestions Incident to its adoption have yet beon\nsolved. Under tlie circumstances, tfce Central\ngave the preference to the direct current, ami\nnow one occasionally hears the suggestion that\n\u25a0when its motors are in actual use they \u2022will be\nobsolete.\nFor their approval of the Central's choice tho\ntechnical Journals present two cogent reasons.\nIn view of the immense amount of traffic to be\nhandled and the vast Inconvenience which\nwould result from a serious interruption, it Is\nbetter to eliminate all doubt and uncertainty\nat the outset Again, certain other railways\u2014\nnotably that In the subway\u2014 which the\nCentral will make connections have decided to\nuse the direct current. It is desirable, of course,\nto have the roiling stock so equipped that trains\nfrom one road ran be run over the tracks of\nthe other and unnecessary changes of car by\npMMBgon averted. To the general public these\nconsiderations will appeal so strongly that it Is\nsafe to say that tho Central's decision will ex\ncite almost unanimous commendation. The pa\ntrons of the road will unquestionably be better\npleased to see a well tried system adopted soon\nthan to be obliged to wait several years longer\nfor the promised Innovation.\nIt Is due to tho Central to remember that It\nhas already displayed a distinctly progressive\n6plrlt in 6evpral ways. The company Is a pio\nneer in the substitution of electricity for steam\non a large scale In this country. For Its power\nstations It has ordered engines of the most\nmodern type\u2014 the steam turbine. The electric\nlocomotives which are to haul Info the city Its\ngreat express trains will likewise represent the\nhitest advances In mechanism which hare stool\nthe test of actual service. Besides, If the time\never comes when the Central deems it expedient\nto Introduce the alternating current, no /orml\ndaWe barrier to the change will exist. No Im\nportant modification will be necessary In the\npow\u00abr stations. Its dynamos would generate\nan alternating current anyhow, and the con\nversion of this Into a diroet current would then\nbe discontinued. As for the motors\u2014 both tho*<\u00bb\nmounted on the trucks of the suburban cars and\nthose employed to draw through trains\u2014 they\ncould probably be sold without grest loss. Th\u00ab\nfuture, therefore, can be left to take care of\nitsolf. The present Is of Infinitely greater Im\nportance.\nSYMPATHY FOR A DRUyKARD.\nIt wa\u00ab anything but typical, stern Jersey\nJufith'e when a Jury in New-Hrunswlck fined a\nririsonor $100 for Inflicting a fatal Injury with\na billiard cue In a drunken brawl with a mnn\nwttla whom bo had been friendly in his sober\nmomenta.\nIt is true the criminal had no Intention of\ntaking the life of his friend. He was so com\npletely Intoxicated that he did not know what\nhe was doing. Hut the courts have usually\nruled that a man must be held responsible\nfor serious offences against the laws, even\nwhen committed under the influence of alcohol.\nThe tine in this en\u00ab<\u00bb mi a grotesquely insuffi\ncient penalty fur this homicide. Surely a long\nterm of Imprisonment should have been Im\nposed, although there was no premeditated and\nmalicious scheme to do mortal harm.

The\npaper results from action taken last June, after\nextensive destruction had occurred In tho Adl\nrnndacks, by the Board of Trade of this city.\nThat organization Instructed Its committee on\nforests to Investigate tho subject with special\nretcrenco to New-York State's own preserves,\nand the duty has been performed in an admi\nrable manner. No one who read's the document\ncan fail to be Impressed with the clearness,\nbreadth and force with which the matter is\nhandled.\nIn most cases tho only damage done by forest\nfires Is to the timber itself. Even this amounted\nto about * $3,000,000 In the Adirondack* last\nMay, to lay nothing of an expenditure of $no,\n000 for fighting the flames. A less frequent but\nmore lamentable consequence of these outbreaks\nIs a loss of life. Five hundred persons perished\nnt Illnckley, Minn., In 1804 in this way, and\nabout one thousand In Wisconsin In IS7L The\nfires in New-York State last spring had no such\ntragic accompaniment, but there are possibili\nties which *houl<l not be Ignored. Many thou\nsand summer visitors go there and to the Cats\nkills every year. From the North Woods, In\nparticular, the avenues of escape are few, long\nand tortuous. Had the great conflagration of\n1003 occurred throe months later thwn It did,\nan unprecedented sacrifice of human life ml\u00bbht\nhave resulted. Still another danger\u2014 one which\nhas boen less distinctly foreseen, but which\nshould be guarded against\u2014 is pointed out In tho\nreport }n\u00ab?t mentioned. On many of the Bteeper\nslopes In the Adlrondacks the burning of the\nold growth hns not been followed by a new\none. An Increasing number of unsightly patches\nis thereby caused. Let that Influence continue\nto operate, and the mountains will lose their\nbeauty \u2014 calamity that would be felt by the\nwhole country, and n\u00abt merely by a limited lo\ncality. Denudation might nlso affect the streams\nwhich rise in the Adirondack, and on which\nindustry relio\u00df for power. Even the question\nof water supply for remote cities may be more\nel#sely rein ted to the ocenrranee of forest ares\nthan Is ir**norally appreciated.\nA groat deal has been heard of late about the\nfeasibility of llmltrng the effect of tires In the\nwood 3 by laving out brond parhn. or \"rides.\"\n\u25a0which intersect one smythpr nt srritable Intervals\nlike city 6trects. The system Is In vogue in\nEurope, but is only applicable to comparatively\nlevel districts. In p. rotten whose surface is so\nIrregular as that of the Adirondack*, thp Board\nof Trade com ml deems It impracticable.\nAnothor drawback to the nrioptlon of that plan\nis that the Staff's ovrn preserves are riot massed\nin a single area. wrap of them being almost or\nqultn snrrotinclvd by the property of Individuals\nor clubs or corporations. There may be parts\nfit the coMirtry whore the erap!oym\u00abnit of such\nlanes would be Judicious, but topographical con\nsiderations discourage their use in Northern\nNew-York.\nNevertheless, the committee is able to make\nfour recomm^ndntlons for the promotion of the\nobject in vVmv, and It expresses the hop*\u00bb thnt\nthese will be *n.nctt?d Into laws. It would have\nthe State's property policed by fire wardens or\nraacera In the season when fires may bo antici\npated; compel all camping parties who enter\nthe preserves to employ guides who have been\nHocused, and who would know enough to pro\nvent fires through carelessness; Increase tbe\npenalty for any destruction that Is traceable to\nrailway locomotives, aud provide for State con\ntrol of water' power and water supply. Con\ncerning the wisdom of the first three of these\npropositions there will be little dispute. A\nmeasure that embodies them should certainly\nreceive favorable consideration at Albany this\nwinter. As to the fourth, ft may be prudent to\nIsolate it from the others temporarily. Xo doubt\nsuch an enactment would assist in preserving\nthe beauty of one of tho mosr famous moun\ntain jrroups In the world, but it Involves n go.nl\nmnny other Interests nlso. Tlie committee\nmay be right In protesting agninst giving tho\ncontrol of the State's water power to nn In\ndividual or a corporation. Whether the State\nneeds to exercise any new functions itself,\nthough. Is a question which ought not to be de\ncided hastily.\nA FORGOTTEN AIOX ARCH'S VIEW OF TT.\nBald Vi, es he flipped his Bohea,\n\u2022Tm oppressed with a painful Idea:\n\"When the Russian and Jap\nAre throuKh with the map\n\"Twill be hard to discover Corea.\"\nTf t>r. \"Woodbury thinks ha got a drenching\nrain by praying for tt, he may be encouraged to\npetition for a warm south wind which would\ncausa the snow U disappear even more rapidly.\nThere was a strong-, yea, an overwhelming,\nantecedent probability that the City Hall\nwouldn't suit its latest occupants, and the ex\npected announcement of Its unfltness has ap\npeared In good time.

I have noted recently,\nwith a feeling of mild amazement, tntimauona\nthat President Roosevelt la losing his popularity\nIn certain parts of the country; that ha :\u00bba\nnot possibly carry his own \"State In NoYtracxr)\nthat ho la unsafe, because given to Impulsive\nactions. These criticisms are not con^ried\nwholly to those politically opposed to the PreH.\ndent. But certain Individuals and newspapers\nof the Republican faith are doing all in ti\u00ablr>\npower to Increase the perplexity of the average\nvoter respecting the worth of our President. la\naddition to what I have referred to above they\ntell us of the part he assumed In the great coal\n\u25a0 trike. and In the Northern Securities case, dap.\nrecatingly, of course; but not a word regard\ning ths masterly way he handled the Venezuela\nproblem. To tha mind of many his conduct at\nthat time was proof positive that he coueasa*\nqualities of the highest stateainanaiiip. H>\u00aba\nafter the danger point had been passed by ti\u00bb*\nagreement on the part of the allies to refer tie\nquestions at Issue to the Hague tribunal, there\nwas considerable criticism directed against Ger\nmany for the* part that country had taken Ci\nthe affair. In an almost Incredibly short period\n0* time the major part of that criticism bad\nceased. On looking over certain newspaper\nclippings of that time I find an item stating that\nthe administration had decided to do all In Its\npower to check that growing feeling of bitter*\nness. Wo must admit I: was a wise decision,\nfor a great deal of harm can come from tbe un\neasiness of a great people. For his paQoaoa\nduring the time the allied nations were enforc\ning the blockade against Venezuela, and for\nhis farsiehted action after the blockad* had\nbeen raised, the President should receive duo\ncredit In an Impartial estirnata of his capacity\nfor executive position.\nAs for Mr. Roosevelt's relation to th* Northern\nSecurities merger, he would have violated hla\noath of office If be na-\u00ab not taken the action no\ndid. 80 far as I can sea. ha has simply brought\nthat Important case before the Supreme Court\nfor It to decide upon the legality of tbe pro\nposed consolidation. And again, those who aro\nfree from prejudice may well say that no Presi\ndent could possibly have assumed a broader\nminded position In relation to the postal scandal\nthan Mr. Roosevelt has chosen to assume. It I*\nrecognized by thoughtful men that dishonesty\nof public ornctals. If unchecked, will prove 1\nmost fearful menace to our public institutions^\nWhy. things have come to such a pass thai son:\u00bb\nof our citizens profess to have no faith In the\nhonesty of any man In State or national legis\nlatures. Of course, that Is pessimism run mad.\nBut. on the other band. It Is a straw of some\nImportance. By the fearless and thorough man\nner In which the President has taken hold ef\nthe postal affairs he has performed an act of\nthe greatest Importance to the country. That\nI* another point to the credit of his statesman\nship.\nThe wage earners feel that in Mr. Roosevea\nthey have a President who I* In sympathy wltA\nthem In their efforts to climb upward. H\u00bb might\nlisten to the single counsel of ihe great financial\nInterests If he cho\u00ab\u00bbe. But he la too great for\nthat.

Painted women with\ntheir peroxide hair marched arm in arm along\nBroadway, shrieking at the highest pitch of their !\nvoice* and rtanrlng In derision around every i\npoUceman they encountered. Men with faces\nthat arc closely identitied with the Tenderloin\nand the racetrack shoved their way Joyfully\nthrough the dense mob, joining with right good\nwll] in the yeiling and furnishing a goodly pro\nportion of the horn blowing. In their hats these\nmen displayed conspicuously a single playing\ncard, which was a popular and significant badge.\n\u2022The iid is ..ft: The lid ia oft:\" was the cry\nwhich was tak'n up by thousands of throats\nand sounded like a triumphal chorus. Every\nnow and again a wild-eyed woman, unable to\ncontrol her joy any longer, would make a sud\nden rush and throw her arms hysterically\naround ihe neck of a passing man. Blond\nwomen, blowing horns, were curried on tht\nShoulders of yelling men, every human chariot\nUrns formed escorted by a bodyguard of about\na hundred horr.blowing men and women.

That the Jubilation wa\ndeeply founded Is plainly to be understood b.\nthose who are in a. position to know the changt\nthat has come over the Tenderloin during the\nlast lew days. All over the Tenderloin gamblers\nhave been secretly planning for weeks to throw\nopdi their houses as soon as the New Year\ndawned.

Disorderly house\nkeepers were preparing to do a flourishing and\nuninterrupted business. Another Tenderloin\nhabitue told a Tribune reporter that sixteen\nplaces of this description were opened last night\ntan various sections of the Tenderloin. As for\nthe women in the streets, there was not one of\nthem who did not beUeve that with the end of\nreform rule good tin.es for then were again in\nsight.\n\"Of course we'll have to give up as we did in\nUrn good old dnys,\" said one of thtin, \"but\nthere'll ba a chance to make good money, which\nthere hasn\"t b^en the last two years.\"\nCaptain Burieiad, ol the Tenderloin station,\nsaid:\n\u2022\"There will be no violations of the law while I\nam in charge here.

If there\nare those who think that Dr. Parkhurst has\nmade special efforts of late, by excessive lndul\nfence 5n sensational modes of speech, to revive\nthe blase of publicity in which he lived for 6ev\nears, we shall not deny that there is 6ome\nJustification for that belief. It is probable that\nin this lostsnce he made a deliberate choice of\netartlinx expressions, foresaw that it would be\ne\u00bbfay to draw false inference* from what he\naald and expected his sermon to provoke hostile\ncriticism. The employment of surh methods is\na matter of taste.\nWe printed the more ttriklnj parts of Dr.\nParkhurst's discourse on Monday raorulns, not\nfor the sake of adding to his notoriPty, but be\nc*u&e. in our opinion, they contained whole\nnme truth* which need to be considered. With\nhit remarks on th\u00ab? eubject of public responsi\nbility for the enforcement of the lar^s It Is hanl\nly possible for a reasonable citizen to disagree,\nand. ao far as we ha^e observed, they have not\nbeen disputed. It Is a fact that \"in a demo\n*\"cr*tic rovernnem like our own the urgency of\n\"a etrtute \u2014 the Relf-executing power of a statute\nCles out of it Just as fast as the popular will\n**fljes out of it; thnt Is to Bay, Just so fast us the\n\"trarnte eeat?\u00bb to be the liriug expression of\n\"the popular determination.\" In Chicago \"pop\nnlar tension\" in respect to the building and nre\nltwe had been relaxed, os It had been almost\nererywhere, and they had become \"a dead let\nter.\" There Is no fault to be found with I\u00bbr.\nP\u00abrkhurst's declaration that \"when a catas\n\"tror'he occurs under the circumstances that\n\"lrarked the catastrophe at Chicago, tlie funda\n\"ineutal responsibility is to be charged home to\n\"the community at large.\" But when he goes\nen to cay that \"the flre that burned those _be\nhundred |>eople was God's flre\" Ills hostile critics\nttir.lc they find their opportunity.\nIf, however. Dr. Parkhurst had chosen to use\na form of word* which could not have been\nsaMuterprrted, be iui;-ht have aald tlie same\nthing with Impunity. The context. In spite of\nIts characteristic and. to borne minds, offensive\nphraeeolory. makes the meaulnp clear to a\nnkwCnl reader. The Almighty has established\ncertain laws which we call the laws of Nature.\nKoine of His creatures are under tb\u00ab impression\nthat they could have made better one?, but at\ntil events thl\u00ab st\u00abte of existence Is inconceiv\nable wirhout them and would be utterly lntol\netame If they were capriciously enforced.

There are distinct indications that Rus-\nsia is Inclined to recede from pome, if not all,\nof her aggressive demands. That may be be\ncause the \"peace party,\" which is the party of\nprogress and of the Czar, has gained dominance\nin Russia. It may be because of the all but\nuniversal sympathy with Japan expressed by\nthe world. It may be because \u2014 we have Rus\nsian authority for saying it\u2014 of the resolute\nstand takeu by the United States in behalf of\nIts treaty rights. It raa\u00bb be because\u2014 as we are.\nnow assured from Ber .in\u2014 France hns grown\nweary of the one sided Russian alliance and\nhas given Russia to understand that she will\nhave no French aid in case of war, not even\nthough other powers should ally themselves\nwith Japan. Whatever the reason, the fact is\npatent, and is welcome. There are, however,\nthree remaining points which need to be set\ntled.\nOne Is suggested r>y the Russian Viceroy of\nthe Far East, Admiral Alexieff, through his\ndiplomatic agent, M. I'lareon. in the declara\ntion that it was unfrieudly and undiplomatic\nfor the United States to make a treaty with j\nCnina without Russia's consent, and that Rus\nsia will not open the ports of Moukden and An-\nTuijg. nor permit T'nited States consuls to go !\nthither. That is a point which Admiral AlexleiT\nand the St. Petersburg government may need <\nto Kettle between them. The course of tho\nUnited States is clear. It asks nobody's con\nsent to its treaty making with another sovereign\npower. It has made the treaty with China, and\nIt Is 6endlas consuls to the two ports named.\nIt expects that they will be properly receive,!, '<\nand that those ports will be opened aud be kept i\nopen to its commerce. So far as the American '\ngovernment pays nttention to Russian utter\nances upon this Etibject, it does so to the dec\nlaration of the Czar's accredited representatlvo\nat Washington, who only last week assured tho\nSecretary of State that Russia would place no\nobstacles in the way of our full enjoyment of\nour treaty rights in Manchuria. We hope and\nbelieve that Count Casslnl will prove to hiivo\nbeen a more accurate exponent of the Czar's\npolicy than Admiral Alexieff.\nA second point Is that of foreign settlements\nin Manchuria, A St. Petersburg dispatch re\nports thnt Russia >?tHI refuses to acquiesce in\nthe treaty rights of foreign power? to make set\ntlements la Mauchuria. though she is, of course,\nherself making such settlements there without j\nuumber and of jjreat extent. Japan, we are |\nalso told, Is inclined to contest this point, which j\nis considered vital. Certainly it does seem !\nvital. TJie annulment of the right to make\ncommercial Rettlcments would practically annul\nor destroy the value of all other rights and '\nprivileges. What good would it be to us to I\niiave the right to trade in Manchuria if our I\ntraders were not permitted to reside in Man- j\nchurian ports? Moreover, since Russia Is mnk\ning nil the eettlemeuts it pleases her to make \\\nin Ifsnrimila. other nations must have the\nsame privilege uuder the \"most favored nation\"\nclanse-a clause which i<* in ur treaty with\nChina.\nThe third point concerns tho Yalu River. Rus- '\nsia Is said to have receded from her pretensions\nto the control of Corea. even of the northern\nhalf of thnt country, and to have admitted that\nit lies within Japan's sphere of influence. But\nshe still Insists that a eonsidera strip along\nthe northern border of Corea, comprising the\nOorean banks of the Yalu and Tiuinen rivers, '\nf-hali bo declared a neutral zone, in which\nJapun ___1 make no fortifications or settle\nment*. But Russia herself already has Bane\nsettlements within It. It does not \"appear that\n\u00bbhe hP.s consented io*abandon and withdraw ,\nfrom them. Moreover. Russia absolutely re- i\nfnaee even to eonsSder JapanTi suggestion that\na similar strip should b<=- neutralized on the. '\nUaacSmrtan side of the Une.

THURSDAY. *OUARY 21. 190-4\n1 Yalu as much as she pleases, but Japan must\nleave the Corcan side entirely open and unde\nj feuded. That i? taid to be unacceptable to\ni Japan. We should tliink it would be.\nV\\*e expect that the United States Vill settle\n1 for ttaeif the matter ef the caewtng of the ports\nand the establishment of Its consuls there, ami\nthat it will do BO la a manner sattltaCtery to\njirc:f and without any breach of the peace or\neven of friendship with Russia. The other two\nmatters Japan has la band for settlement, and\n\u25a0 it is intimated that she considers tliem of >-utli\ncient Importance to warrant her lv Koin^ to\nj war over them if a settlement cannot be ef\n1 fected by peaceful means. It would be lamen\ntable to hajre a war. Cut we cannot truly say\ni that Japan seems to overestimate the impor\ntance oi* those points. It is to be hoped that\n, Russia will come to a recognition of the justice\nof .Japan's contention, and will gracefully re\nj cede on those points, as she is believed already\n! to have done on others. In that way peace will\nprobably be assured. There seems to be. no as\n; surance <<{ it on any other ground.\nOOTBR \\OR VARDAXAJra POLICY.\nTho new Governor of Mississippi in his in\nangural a'.Mress says exactly what was to be\nexpected from him. lie was chosen by the re\nactionary elements over men who stood for\nprogress and justice to the ne.^ro as an expres\nsion of their bitter spirit toward President\nKoosevelt because ho recognized the equal\nrights of negroes .as dtiaena under the law.\nGovernor Vardaman charges that the negro\nrace is as a whole rapidly deteriorating, mid\nihat education, instead of preventing crime, pro\nmotes it. lie marshals figures to show that the\nnegroes of the North, who are better educated\nihan their Southern fellows, ure also more\ncriminal. He asks for an amendment to the\nState constitution authorising the legislature\nto distribute the school fund between the races\nat it? discretion, so as to turn all taxes paM\nby white persons to white Khoolfl an>l keep the\nnegroes in practically entire Illiteracy. This has\nbeen a favorite ambition of h's school of p\u00ab>ii\nticians in several Southern States, but they\nhave so far been signally defeated whenever\nthe issue hns heeii squarely made, and against\nthem are all the most Intelligent white leaders\nIn the South, the oollejre presidents of Southern\nbirth and education and progressive politicians\nlike Governor Ayeock of .North Carolina. Thp\u00abe\nmen are as determined as anybody to maintain\nthe supremacy of white civilization in the Booth,\nbut they realize that the only way to solve the\nrace problem is to do justice and help the negro\nto advance. The South cannot kppp half its\npopulation In barbarism without itself being\nbarbarized.\nThe statements of Governor Vnrdaman about\nthe retrogression of the negroes iiro contra\ndicted by those of hundreds of unprejudiced ob\n\u00aborver*. They are steadily Increasing their\nwealth, and coming more and more to a realiza\ntion that there is no short cut to prosperity, but\nthnt they must follow Booker Washington's\nfidvice and by hard and honest work nnd good\nConduct make themselves respected. Undoubt\nedly after the abolition of slavery the negro\nwere Impracticable In their aspirations. It was\ninevitable that they should be. but that they\nhave not made progress, and astonishing prog\nres?, in view of their condition and antecedents,\nis not true. Perhaps no race starting frntn\nutter savagery ever advanced faster thnn the\nnegro race in the United States. The statistics\nof criminal negroes in the North are not fair to\nthe race. Ft is largely the adventurous who\ncome North, seek the cities and take on tha\n\u25bcices of the whites. The necro^s who nr* edu\ncated ns their own wisest leaders wlah are not\ncriminals. They nre working on f.-trnis nnd in\ntrade*, trying to mnke honest Urines hiul help\ntheir fellows on the same road. They are teach\ning and preaching the gosi v\\ of work They\nwant to mnke useful. Intelligent citizens. Gov\nernor Vardaman's policy would mako uuintelll\ngent helots.\nXSrO RTA Tlo\\ WUIBA XCES.\nThe people of this city b\u00abv# been trented to\ntwo Innovations in transportation during tho\nlast few dny*. The more Important as well as\nThe more recent of them wns lutroduced | v the\nboroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx. in con\nformity with a municipal ordinance adopted\nlast year. Surface cars are now required to\nstop on the near crossing. instead of the fur\nther one. to discharge and take on passengers.\nIn defence of the plan it may be urged that it\nassimilates the practice on ono side of the East\nRiver with that which has long boon followed\non the other. Inasmuch as a considerable num\nber of the people who make use of one set of\nfacilities patroatop the other also, something\nwould be gained by insuring uniformity of habit\nThe chief merit of the system, however is that\nit minimizes the risk of collision with teams\nmoving through cross streets at right angles\nwith tho street railways. The risk, no doubt\nhas been Increased by the substitution of e!ee\ntrtctty for cables and horse p, er, beeiiuso\nhigher speeds are vow possible than formerly.\nAll Ihe same, the public inconvenience which\nattends the new usage will always be so great\naa to outweigh these considerations. In line\nweather it does not matter where the cars stop.\nWhen snow, slush or mud prevails, it is litUe\nShort of an outrage to compel passengers to em\nbark and alight forty or fifty feet from a cross\nwalk. That ordinance ought to bo repealed\npromptly, and when such action is takeu the\ncity fathers may well consider the propriety\nof restoring to Brooklyn the custom observed\nthero ten or twelve years ago.\nAnother change, made experimentally by the\nBrooklyn Itnpid Transit Company, affects traffic\non the bridge on Sundays. Local trains are\nthen taken off, and an attempt is made to pro\nvide for those patrons who wish merely to\ncross the river by carrying them on elevated\nrailway trains. The latter stop tirst at one plat\nform for through passengers, and then at a\nsecond for local passengers, the rear car being\nreserved for those who expect to leave at the\nBrooklyn terminal. Uuferttmately, the number\nof people standing on the ancoud platform in\nthe Manhattan station is often too great to h<*\naccommodated in a single coach. Much vexa\ntion and delay result at the outset, therefore.\nStill further trouble is experienced on the other\nside. Only a part of the passengers who there\nalight from tiie rear probably not over half\n\u2014want to go down to the fltreet. A considera\nble number wish to take certain elevated rail\nway trains nt that point. In order to do so\nthey must follow an unusual route. They are\nnot permitted to .stay ou the platform where\nthey alight until they reach the staircase lead-\nS-ig upward to the elevated station. They arc\nrequired lirst to go down one flight, in order to\nbuy tickets. Thus they Jostle those people who\nare bound for the street, exhibit excusable un\ncertainty about the proper disposition of their\ntickets, and drive the rapid transit employes\nnearly frantic with their questions nnd blun\nders.\nIt does not take long to discover a possible\nremedy for these vexations. If, In accordance\nwith the evident intention of the company, all\nwho want to travel on elevated roads would\nesahnrk at tho first platform in the Manhattan\nsiatlon, there would probably be plenty of room\nIn the rear car for strictly local passengers,\nwho would have no further cause for complaint.\nThe people who chare these accommodations\nwith them, it is asserted, are aiming for the\nRidgewood and U Itpnave, lines. Access to\nthese can be Uad hi two ways. Cue can etart\nfrom Manhattan on a Fifth-aye. or Bath Beach\ntrain and transfer nt Bridge-st., or he can go\nacross the river with the local passengers :v,v\\\ntransfer at the Brooklyn terminal. Each plan\nhas its drawbacks, a. F.ridge-st. one is l\u00abss\ncertain of securing a scat than at High-st., but\nto make the change at fhe former point takes\nless rime and trouble than- at the latter. From\nthe behavior <>f at least a few of those who in\nsist oa effecting the transfer at the Brooklyn\nterminal of the bridge, it is apprm m tlj.it they\nare comparative strangers, and not regular\np:itn>!is. Perhaps the others, who have hitherto\nchosen their route deliberately, may be per\nsuaded to adopt the plan propoeed by the Rapid\nTransit Company, The experiment may work\nbetter after a little further trial.\nCOLD WEATHER.\nFrostbitten Ameri as they rub their\nsitin^rlnK ears ur.J beal together their numbe 1\nfiiiKers, complain bitterly that this winter is\nelmost bntelerahle.

Jar.. 3.\u2014 Mrs. EUen Dortch\nTjongstreet. widow of General James Longstreet,\nthe Confederate commander who died yesterday,\nhas replied to the charges that he lost the battle\nof Gettysburg, recently reiterated by General\nGordon. She says that General Gordon occupied\na subordinate position at Gettysburg, and hence\nknows nothing of th\"i matter at ilrst hand, and\ncontinues:\nIt is nl^nlflcant that not one word was ever uttered\nagainst Longstreet's military record until the man\nwho could forever fttlenca the calumny was In his\n\u25a0 !\u25a0\u00bb> mill! the knightly soul of Hobert Edward\nLee hail passed Into eternity. General L.on\u00dfStreet'a\noperation* at Gettysburg were above th\u00ab* suspicion\nof reproach until i:<* <nir.\u00bb\" under the political ban of\ntha South, by meeting, as he saw it. the require\nments of good citizenship in the observance of his\nAppomattes parole.\nThen the storm broke. He was hf-rnldeii as traitor,\ndeserter of his people. rte!-\u00bb>rter of Democracy, etc.\nIn the fury of this onslaught orlKlnated the cruel\nslander that he had disobeyed Lee's most vital\norders, causing the loss of th\u00ab Gettysburg battle\nand the ultimate fa'l of the Confederate cause.\nThe ee\u00ab*tional complaint that hf deserted \"D\u00bb\nmooraey,\" Is about as relevant and truthful a* the\nassertion thai h^ lost Gettysburg He was a West\nI'eU.'er, a professional soldier; he had never casi\na ballot before the Civil War; he had no politic*;\nits pensions and prejudices had no dwelling place\nIn his mind. '1 he war was over, and he quietly ac\nc\u00abpted the result, fraternrzln\u00df with nil American.\nIt was no great crime. Hut the peculiar cirfum-\nStancet favored the copjiplracy to make Long^treet\nthe loop desired scapegoat for Gettysburg. There\nwas an ulterior and deeper purpose, however, than\nmerely besmtiching hla military record. Short-\nBlghted partisans seemingly argued that the dis\nparagement of T-onftstreff was necessary to ray\u00ab\nthe. inlltary reputation of l.cc. But Lee's great\nfame needed no surh sacrifice.\nTh\u00ab\u00bb outrageous charges against Lonpstreet have\nbeen wholly disproved Much of the partisan ran\ncor that once pursued him has died out. Many of\nthe more intHURf-nt Southerners have long been\nconvinced that he was the victim of a great wrong.\nGENERAL LONGSTREET'S FUNERAL.\nGainesville.

Jan. \"Do not look for a decla\nration of war.\" gays \"The Daily Telegraph's\"\nToklo correspondent In a dispatch, which ap\nparently throws considerable light on the plans\nof the Japanese government.

Russia will not be al\nlowed to occupy Corean ports, and certainly\nneither Mokphe nor Mesanpho. both of these\nports being protected against seizure.\nJapan means business without waiting for the\nconvenience of others. If Russia feels aggrieved,\na fortnight should show the extent to which sh\u00ab\nwill venture The interest should begin at a\ncentre nearer Seoul than Tokio within ten days,\nbut the naval overture may retard the piece\nIt is thought despite her bluster that Russia\nwill take no immediate action to prevent Japan\ndoing what she thinks proper to safeguard her\nInterests In Corea.\nThe foregoing probably refers to the dispatch\nof the squadron to Masanpho.

Alaclt, New-York's\nmember of the Democratic National Committee,\nand others representing the South and \"West, it\nhad been determined to urge the claims of New-\nYork vigorously, but the discussion apparently\nchanged this intention. Views were exchanged\nwhich made It apparent to the New-Torksrs\nthat there was a determined and aggressive ele\nment in the committee antagonistic t\u00bb the ; \u25a0-\nlection of New- York, and the argume:.'< set.\nforth were of such a character as effectually to\nput an end to the efforts for the selection of that\ncity. The name of New-York will be perfunc\ntorily presented, but beyond this It Is not likely\nthat anything will be done.\nChicago is unquestionably the choice of a ma\njority of the committee, ar.d this choice 13\nbacked up by the sentiment of the rank an:l\nfile of the party. Little is hearl in favor of\nthe selection of St. Louis, although that city\nstands ready with a $40,000 guarantee should\nher claims be favorably considered, and Mayor\nRo'lo 'Wells, ex-Mayor Walbridge and a dele\ngation from the St. Louis Business Men As\nsociation are in charge of the boom.\nThe Chicago boomers were not only the fir~t\nto arrive, but they h.ive made thoir presence\nfelt. They are also in possession of \"the gootts**\nin the shape of a certified check for $10,000,\n\u2022which can be had fr>r the asking.

Jan. 15. \u2014 Discussion by legislators\nduring the present week of the probable method\nof taxation which will be employed to raise the\nmoney necessary to build the new barge carial\nhas disclosed a rather striking unanimity of\nopinion that at lenst one measure which the\nGovernor had in his mind at the time he sent\nhis message to the legislature was a record tax\non mortgages. The assertion was made at the\nCapitol this week by a person entirely familiar\nwith the subject of taxation that it was the gen\neral impression in Haw-York City among those\nwho had given the matter careful thought that\nthe Governor's plan when it was finally made\npublic would be purely and simply this, the tax\nbeing in all probability five mills. Such a tax\nwould raise approximately $3,000,000 annually,\nthe sum which, it will be remembered, the Gov\nernor believed sa>uld be necessary for the first\ntwo years.\nIt will he recoiled that in his last message\nGovernor Od*Jl called the attention of the legis\nlature to the subject of a mortgage tax, and\n\u25a0aid, with what was believed at the time to be\nof considerable significance:\nMuch of the assessment in New-York City is\noccasioned by taxation upon mortgages, which\nshould not ex!?t. and which Is a positive, burden\n\\o rnnny, ar.tl ii; frequent ens*** t\u00abVi?5 _~.\"\u00bb\u00a3 Zm\nper c* l^ *>*'\u25a0 trrr^Jr.rrrni* :\u00bb*jl)i >;:*n /b\\\\n t'r>\ntreatment of this class of personal property in\nits contribution to the expends of government\nfir would tend to minimize the unjust proportion\ncf payment of taxes.\nIn two previous messages Governor Odell has\ndealt with the question of a, mortgage tax. an 1\nhas recommended the abolition of the direct tax\nand a one and two mill record tax. He Is known\nctill strongly to advocate the abolition of the\ndirect tax. but it is the opinion of those who\nare best Informed on the subject that the\nabolition la a matter which requires several\nyears more of education for the public. ThU\nopinion was expressed only the other day by a\nNew- York City oAetal whose ideas carry weight\nin this matter. The prevailing notion is that\nboth in his reference In the message and In his\ntwo previous recommendations of a more di\nrect character the Governor foreshadowed the\nline of action that he believes the legislature\nshould take in raising the ?101,.1(tO,000 necessary\nfor the construction of the canal.\nThis new record tax will not affect, it la gen\nerally believed, any existing mortgages, but sim\nply apply to new mortgages. The minimum\nsum raised annually by such a tax la estimated\nat dBOQiOOOIi That this may be too low an es\ntimate, and that the Governor has been able to\nfigure a larger income, is also suggested. The\nburden of this tax, as, indeed, of any tax for\nthe canal, would fall on New-York City, and\nit has been reasoned that there will be a con\nsiderable effort made to defeat such a measure,\nalthough, of course, until the matter la definitely\nknown, no action can even be conjectured. It\nlv, however, an undoubted fact that it Is along\nthis line that the real estate and financial In\nterests are looking- for the taxation plan.\nThe question of when this important measure\nwould be Introduced has naturally occasioned\nmore or less guessing. It was said at the\nCapitol yesterday, with some show of credibility,\nthat whatever measure was Introduced to meet\nthis necessity would not make Its appearance\nbefore the middle of February. The only canal\ninterest of present. Importance is the appoint\nment by the Governor of the canal commission.\nThe names of this board are expected next week.\nK. A. Bond, State Engineer, Is generally be\nlieved to be Elated for a place on this commis\nsion.\nDUKE SOUGHT DIVORCE.\nPhilip of Orleans Revoked Petition\nat Emperor's Request.\nVienna, Jan. I.\".\u2014 The \"Allgemeine Zeitung\"\nsays that Duke Philip of Orleans is seeking a\ndivorce, and that, he has petitioned the Curia\nfor a dispensation to enable him to marry the\ndaughter of a great Austrian noble. The \"All\ngemeine Zeitung\" asserts that the duke con\nsulted the leading members of the Royalist\nparty last summer and Informed them of his\nintentions, giving as a renson that his present\nunion was childless and that he desired to con\ntinue the royal line. The Royalists endeavored\nto dissuade the duke from taking the action\nbe proposed, and pointed out to him that his\ndivorce end remarriage would scandalize Cath\nolic circles in France, the chief supporters of\nthe Royalist cause.\nInvestigation In well Informed circles shows\nthat it was the duke's intention to obtain a\ndivorce from the arebducheaa, but that through\nthe personal intervention of Emperor Francis\nJosopll the differences of the couple were ad\njusted, the duke withdrawing his petition to the\nCuria.\nThe wootaa whom the duke desired to marry\nis said to be the Princess Clementine, daughter\nof Pauline, Princess de Metternlch-Sandor.\nIt is said that the strong devotion of the arch\nduchess to duty is displeasing to the duke.

Lord Lansdowne to-day,\nhowever, expressed disbelief that Russia had\nany intention of trying to send a fleet through\nthe Dardanelles, adding that it would be an ob\nvious breach of treaty in which Great Britain\ncould not possibly acquiesce.\nBy the Treaty 0/ London, signed in 1841 by the\nfive great powers of Europe nnd by Turkey, the\nSultan was pledged to maintain the rule of the\nOttoman Empire which prohibited the warships of\nany foreign power from entering the Dardanelles\nwhile Turkey was at peace, and, at the same time,\nthe treaty bound the powers to observe this rule.\nThis was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris In 1556\nand by the Convention of IS7I. which set forth that\n\"tho principle of closing the straits, such as It has\nbeen established.

Th\u00b0y assert that Sena\ntor Hanna Is too hlghminded a politician and too\n, fair a fighter to permit of his doing anything\nunderhanded, and declare that \"there is no\nstudied attempt to withhold the call for the\nnational convention.\" They also add numerous\nexcuses for the delay In calling the convention,\nreciting Mr. Hanna's ill health and Mr. Heath's\npress of business matters.\nThose leaders whose devotion to the President\nis unquestioned are disposed to accept the ex\ncuses in good part, and express gratification\nthat the postponement of the call is not the re\nsult of any studied attempt, frankly admitting\nthat they were disappointed that the national\nchairman did no: find it convenient to come to\nWashington and issue the call as soon as his\nre-election to the Senate had taken place, in\nstead of returning to Cleveland, but they feel\ncertain that, now the attention of the Senator\nfrom Ohio has been called to the importance of\nprompt action, he will permit no further delay.\nWith regard to the publication of the report,\nwhich was in general circulation at the Capitol\nyesterday. It is believed that its effect cannot\nbut prove beneficial. It is but one of several\nrumors, similar in their import, which have been\nin circulation in the last two weeks, and its\npublication has afforded the friends of Senator\nHanna an opportunity to explain the delay and\ndeny any purpose of inconveniencing the friends\nof the President. It has further served to make\nplain the desire of those Republicans who have\nthe best Interests of the administration at heart\nto hold early conventions.\nSenator Hanna is expected in Washington at\nan early date. pOF3ibly to-morrow, and will, it\nis believed, immediately issue the call for the\nnational convention. It is regarded as desira\nble that all doubt as to the unity of the party in\nits support of the President be promptly .Im\npelled, and the calling of the State conventions\nand the relection of delegates to the national\nmeeting will do much to dispel any lurking\ndoubt which may exist. As a matter of fact.\nSenator Penro.se has felt it desirable to issue the\ncull for the Pennsylvania convention without\nwaiting for the national call, and has to-.!ay\nsent out the notices which were prepared yester\nday and held up only because of the ruiror pub\nlished In The Tribune this morning. Mr. Pen\nrose is still in Philadelphia, presumably con\nferring with Senator Quay, but he telegraphed\nto Colonel Andrews to-. lay to issue the State call.\nA thorough search of the history of the Re\npublican conventions has proved that the ex\necutive committee could find no justification for\nattempting to enforce the \"unit rule\" by the\nframing of its call. In the national convention\n\u25a0\u25a0!\" MM a resolution, offered by Mr. Boutwell, of\nMassachusetts, and amended by Mr. Butter\nworth, of Ohio, was adopted, providing. In part,\n\"that such methods or rules shall Include or\nsecure to the several Congress districts in\nthe United States the right to elect their own\ndelegates to the national convention.\" Thi3, the\namendment of Mr. Butterworth, was adepted\nonly after a fierce contest, as its adoption re\nsulted .in the defeat of the third term candidacy\nof President Grant. Since that time there Baa\nbeen no action which could asaaaatj be con\nsSfued as relieving the party from thf\u00bb aMl\u00dfsjejasj\ncf that rule.\nIt is. further pointed out that at the last\nmeeting of the Republican National Committee\na resolution was adopted instructing that the\nform of the call of 1900 b\u00bb used In calling the\nconvention of this year, and that, in Itself.\nwould prevent any attempt materially to change\nit. These facts have been called to the atten\ntion of the doubters, and they express their\nwillingness to abandon their former belief as\nto the occasion of the delay in the issue of the\nnational call, but it Is evident thai they will\nfeel relieved when the call :.-; actually issued.\nQuite apart from the reasons which have thus\nfar delayed the issue of the call are these ad-\nCeatlaueti <m second pace.\nPRICE THREE CENTS.\nBRYAN BEHIND HEARST.\nBOOM WORRIES WIGWAM.\nMurphy Says He's Sot Committed,\nbut Think* Cleveland Can Win.\nWilliam R.

Murphy and Senator Patrick H.\nMcCarren will. It was said laet night by one of\ntheir intimate friends In Tammany Hall, tell the\nDemocratic National Committee in Washington\nnexi Tuesday that New -York State is solidly\nfor ihe nomination of Chief Judge Alton B.\nParker of the Court of Appeaia, for President.\nSenator McCarren will start for Washington on\nSunday night. Mr. Murphy, according to the\nPresent understanding, will see Chairman Jones\nand the other members of the committee on Sun\nday night Mr. Murphy Is expected in New-\nYork on Monday. He left town on Tuesday\nniffht for Annsipolls. Washington and Atlantic\nCity. If Meaara. Murphy and McCarren find\nthe drift In the National Committee toward\nParker. It is likely that Norman K. Mack, of\nBuffalo, will resign as the New-York member\nof the committee and be succeeded by Senator\nMcCarren. and should the National Convention\nnominate Judge Parker. Senator McCarren will\nbe chosen by him as chairman of the National\nCommittee.\nIt is not expected that Mr. Murphy, so far in\nadvance of the meeting of the National Con\nvention, will make an open announcement that\nthe .New- York State delegation will be for Judge\nParker. In order to make the drift toward the\njudge oiill more marked, it will only be neces\nsary for Messrs. Murphy and McCarren to tell\nthe members of the National Committee that\nevery one In New-York want- Parker. There\nFeems to be a general sentiment in favor of a\nNew- York man for the head of the ticket, and\nthe Southern Senators seem to show a marked\npreference for Judge Parker.\nThe race at the present time among Demo\ncrats here seems to have narrowed to two men-\nParker and Gorman. Senator Gorman's Intense\nracial prejudices, on which he made a winning\ncampaign for his Benatorship, has put him at a\ngreat disadvantage with Judge Parker In the\nNorthern States, according to Mr. Murphy's\nfriends, and for that reason he Is a poor second\nat this time.\nIn view of the developments last nic; it. it la\nnow believed that Judge Parker's aba nee from\nthe McClellan dinner on Monday night, when his\nboom might have assumed undu\u00ab prominence,\nwas intentional, and that it was on the advice\nof Messrs. Murphy and McCfirren that he\nstayed away.\nThe elevation of Senator McCarren, first to\nthe National Committee and then, in case Judge\nParker is nominated, to the head of the Na\ntional Committee, is a deal that is believed to\nOoaHawe* on limit >*\u2014 i\nSEVENTEEN DIE IN WRECK\nHE A DON COLLISION.\nNew-York Doctor Hero of Rock\nIsland Accident.\nTopeka, Kan., Jan. o.\u2014 The Rock Island's Cali\nfornia and Mexico Express, which left Chicago\non Monday night for th.- Weet, was In a head-on\ncollision with a cattle train early this morning\nat Wlllard, Kan., fourteen miles west of here.\nSeventeen persons were kill! 1 ami thirty-seven\nInjure.!.\nTHi: DEAD.\nUl.irZli.

On the contrary.\nRussia in the month of October made certain\nconcessions, which were accepted by Japan, but\nsubsequently withdrew them and assumed an\nattitude which left the Japanese little hope in\nthe way of reaching a satisfactory agreement.\nThe Japanese government, confident in the\ndeclarations of disinterestedness in Manchuria\nmade by Russia, and recognizing Russia's spe\ncial interests in that region, wished to regulate,\nonce for all, all questions in the Far East, in\nthe interest of future peace and tranquillity.\nTo this end Japan made the following proposals:\nFirst\u2014 Russia, and Japan should mutually respect\nthe Independence and territorial integrity of China,\nand Corea.\nSecond\u2014 recognise reciprocally.

Of hardly\nsecondary Interest was the truest ion of where the\nGovernor proposed to raise the additional\n$.\"..-\u25a0\u00ab \u00bb>.\u25a0>>\u2022\u2022 annually to carry out hi 3 plan, sinca\nhis method was not outlined in the message.\nAt rlrst the general Impression was that there\nwould be another increase in excise taxes, but it\nwas quickly developed that de prospect of any\nsuch legislation was ex jee..!ingly slim. More\nover, the recommendations respecting the mort\ngage tax contained in the message also elimi\nnated this source of possible revenue. That tha\nGovernor has told his friends that he has a plan\nIn his pocket complete in every detail is cer\ntain, but what that plan is has not yet been\ndivulged. That the raising of this sum, or at\nleast the passage of legislation providing for\nthis Increased revenue, is on the programme for\nthe present session Is certain, for while th<\u00bb\nState treasury has in the surplus th* $'J,\u00bb\u00bbMt.\n000 needed for the first year, the general opinion\nIs that definite settling of the Question is de\n[ sirable.\nQues*lor>a a* *\u00ab\u25ba t!w constitutionality o;\nj various phases of the Governor's i \u2022* uH'ilM\u00df>m\u00bb*\ntlona are, as he points out in the message, like\nly to be raised, notably in the matter of th-\u00bb\nloans by the counties, possibly, also in the case\nof the counties of greater New-York, as M the\nlegal right to increase the county debt; but\nthese are questions that will be covered by legis\nlation before the necessity for the money actu\nally arises. Within the next ten day? Governor\nOde!l will appoint the advisory board, to oc\n\u25a0 .rate with the State officials in solving tha\ntngt\u00dfeerica difficulties of the new project.\nEDUCATIONAL SITUATION.\nNext in Interest after th-> canal recommenda\ntions contained In the Governor's message ,wa*\nthat relating la the public school situation. Hla\nproposition to divide the spheres of the Regents\nand th-> Department of Public Instruction on the\nbasis of primary and academic education was\nthe subject of much favorable comment. Th-\u00bb\nconsensus of opinion was that the Governor had\nproposed a method <<( final settlement of existing\ndifficulties which was practicable and at the\nsame time necessary.\nThe Governor's reference to home rule was\nthe topic of considerable argument. It was\nagreed that the Governor did not in his refer\nence to the use of police for partisan purpose*\nintimate that any State constabulary measure\nwas i.> be expected, for it is known that the de\ncision of the Court of Appeals in the case of\nthe Albany police had practically declared\nState constabulary unconstitutional.\nThat the Governor was in (MM way touching\non the excise situation was generally suspected;\nit was. moreover, pointed out that he had previ\nously suggested a referendum on the excise\nquestion to the State, however, and not to the\ncitizens of greater New- York.\nThat the Governor merely intended to call at\ntention to this question of vital importance ac\nthe present moment is the general theory. Sim\nilarly, the directing of the attention of the leg\nislature to the inequalities of til mortgage tax\nis interpreted as raising the question more to\ncall the attention of the legislature to it :han to\nprepare for any prearranged action.\nThe Govern. has already recommended both\nthe abolition of tr-.e mortgage tax and the sub\nstitution of two different tixes of record. Both,\nof these recemme:: iaiions wen without effect.\nOther subjects considered in the message were\ndlstussed. but the vast Importance of the canal\nproject dwarfed all else, and whea the legis\nlature reconvenes this plan will he the subject of\n\u25a0ICtspfSa fl comment, which was in some meas\nure impossible to- lay, owing to the complexity\nof the Governor's plan, on which the legislature\nvi^*)e<; to study, rather than comment.\nFor text of the governor's m\u00ab\u00aba|t -.<\u25a0<\u2022 third pen.\nSENATE IN SESSIOX.\nLieutenant Governor ll ig gins Make*\nBrief Address.\nAlbany, Jan. 6.\u2014 The Senate was called to order\nby Lieutenant-Governor Bbjbjlm shortly after 13\no'clock to-day.

There Is reason to believe\nthat bilis on the subject of taxation will be of\nIces importance than in the last session, al\nthough there are those who look for the reap\npearanc* of the mortgage tax measure in some\nform or slaw.\nBut that the present session \u25a0rill be known as\na c*r\u00bbal legislature, because of the extent and\nImportance of its canal legislation, srenu en\ntirely probable.

Still anoiher method which may\nappear is that of securing for the State the\ntaking up of fSdUOOOuOOO at the bonds without\nInterest by the counties. This latur an is\ngenerally regarded as unlikely, because of the\nheavy burden it lays on the counties and the\npossibility that it mig-ht prove unconstitutional.\nPROPERTY FOR NEW CANAL BOOTS.\nAnother important, piece of canal legislation\nthat is expected is a bill authorizing the ap\npointment ty the Governor, of a. board of\nappraisers to view the property .-which will DS\ntai:en by the new route of the -canal, and in\nsome nwsnrr. at least, to avoid a long and\nexren^i\\>! condemna-ticn proceeding tollowlng\nthe taking of the land by the State.

It Is, in fact, almost necessary\nfor a man to keep a set of book* on himself If he\nwould know where he. stands. More is a case In\npoint:\nJust Wfor\u00bb nailing from New-York I changed a\nsura of money Into English gold (sovereigns,), as I\nwas advised that English gold only wua accepted\non the Isthmus. It was a foolish thing to do, as\nAmerican gold and American banknotes are more\nvaluable hero and better liked than is the inonuy\nof England, but in my Ignorance l did the foolish\nthing, paying $4 8S for each English sovereign.\nUpon arrival at Colon I wished to Koiul a i able dis\npatch to the States. Tho cable toll was $10 85 Colom\nbian sliver. 1 laid down an English sovereign, which\nwa^j accepted at $11 (Colombian), so that I bad la\ncents change due me, and for this amount I got an\nAmerican live-cent piece and a copper cent. Sev\neral persona endeavored to tell me how much\nthe cable cost in American money, but none have\nsucceeded. 1 leave it with the rtaiior us an cx\nami.li of the Intricacies of this monetary system,\nwhich, most conimeiidably. Panama hopes soon to\nabandon for ihe gold basis.\nWhether Panama wUl*be able to realise upon this\nexpectation Is another problem There an abso\nlutely no statistics available showing exactly, or\neven approximately, the amount of this stiver\nmoney In circulation on the Isthmus. Colombia\nnever hud any Interest in the matter, as the circu\nlation of this sliver waa confined to this depart\nment; nor was the money Itself liked by <\"*olombia,\nwhich always regretted the fact that the commer\ncial requirements of this particular Btate prevented\nher from foisting upon It her own worthless paper.\nShe never made any effort, therefore, to keep\nStatistics, and while It Is believed that there Is\nsomething Ilka Jl.ftOu.ooo of the silver In existence,\nnothing definite Is known on this point. It Is.\nhowever, the purpose of the republic, as explained\nby nor Manuel K. Amador. Minister of Finance,\nand indorsed by the Junta, to retire all of this as\nsoon as possible. For this purpose it Is proposed to\nuse a* much of the 110,000.000 gold to be paid by\nthe United States for the canal concession as may\nbe required.\nThe plan as far as It has been outlined is to\ndeposit the necessary gold In the public treasury\nas a guarantee fund, and then issue a paper cur\nrency, redeemable in gold, and by proper legisla\ntion fix a rate of exchange us between gold or the\ngold secured paper and silver. Should this plan\nBe adopted th* rate of exchange will probably he\nfixed at tl gold for $2 silver, and silver dollars and\nhalf dollars one* received at the treasury will not\nbe reissued, exofpt when received In the form of an\nintrinsically valuable subsliiary currency.\nSOUND MONEY SCHEiIE. .\nMuch difficulty is, however, expected before this\nDiari can tie put Into operation. All l'tuuirt avoid*\nColombian papor as It would th* plague. Nobody\non the isthmus will handle the worthless stuff.\nSilver has been so long in use that no other money,\nexcept gold, is known, the Ignorance of any other\nbeing so extensive that among the natives Amer\nican nickels and coppers are refused when offered.\nThe officials all realise that II will be a long and\ntedious task to educate the people to understand\nthai a paper currency, secured by a public deposit\n\"i gold i.s worth its face value. To overcome this\nnational prejudice against paper will be the great\nest difficulty in the way of acceptance of the plan.\ny<r the Panamans ar\u00ab counting with absolute con\nnaenoa upon the ratification of the canal treaty\nami the early payment to them of the *.\".-- \u2022 In\nAmerican gold.\nThis matter of converting the currency system\nfrom a depreciated and varying silver basis to the\ngold standard is. however, the smaller horn of the\nfinancial dilemma confronting Panama. Under the\nold regime the revenues for thia department are\nsupposed to have aggregated about 1500.000 annually\nibis amount may not be exact, at the statistics\nare very faulty. Half a million la given, however.\nus a safe estimate for purposes of calculation\nThese revenues are derived from several sources,\nand were supposed to be of two classes- one for th\u00ab\nnational and the other for the departmental ex\nchequer. Colombia managed very successfully to\ngobble all of it. but the nctlonary division is still\nused In the bookkeeping. The national share earns\nfrom an import tax on alcoholic liquors, from a\nnominal tax on real estate, and from the- sale of\ncertain of the concessions that have proved such\na bane to the isthmus. The departmental revenues\nwere variously derived from a tax on the produc\ntion of alcoholic liquors, from a nominal license\n\u2022 \u00bb assessed against saloons, and from the sale\nof certain other concessions. The amount named\nund the sources from which It was derived do not\nInclude the sum of (250.066 (gold) annually paid by\nthe canal company for its concession. of this\namount ' 5.000 (gold) was supposed to go to the\nDepartment of Panama, although the whole sum\nwas always taken by the government of Bogota.\nUpon this amount It Is useless to figure, as during\non i of her bankrupt moments, many years ago,\nColombia went to the usurers and discounted th.s\nicesiiim fee for a ten of years which will not\nexpire until nine years hence; so that until ulz\nPanama cannot count upon receiving any revenue\nfrom the canal concession by way of rental pay\nments.\nTHE REVENUES MUST SHRINK.\nThin Introduces the most serious difficulty before\nUrn new republic. By the terms of the treaty with\nPanama the United States does not begin to pay\nthe KSO.OSO annual rental for the canal aon\u00ab until\nth\u00ab year 1913. Under the same agreement Colon and\nPanama, tha only ports at which there la any\ncustom hou** business of consequence, are mad\u00ab. to\na!l tents and purposes, tree for th* entry of\nmerchandise of all classes.\nNow. Befior Amador, Minister of Finance who\nwas departmental treasurer during the Colombian\ndominion, estimates that threM-fifthfi, or 1900.000 of\nall the revenues, national and departmental, were\nderived from the customs duties. This sum will by\nthe provisions of the treaty with th* United States.\nexists to bo collected, and the revenues of the new\nrepublic will, In consequence, be cut down to ..::.\u2022;\nthing like 1300.000 (sliver) annually.\nFigure us they will and they are, figuring hard\nand very closely\u2014 the officials of the new republic\ncannot discover how it will be possible for them to\nconduct the government or. a sum under 5;-\u00bb\u00ab \u2022\u2022\u00ab\u25a0>\n(silver) a year. To bring the expenses within that\nsum the army U to be reduced to mere nothing\nness; the navy li to b\u00ab permitted to lapse Into an\nalmost visionary state, and oth.-lai salaries ar\u00ab\u00bb to\nbe fixed at tii- lowest limit conslHtent with good\nservice and th\u00bb preservation of satisfaction and\ncontentment In nttlt !al circles.\nWith ail of this Panama looks a deficit of about\n53U0.000 a year squarely In the face. Under these\ncircumstances. It la not difficult to understand the\ndesperation of her Immediate financial prospects\nThe situation may be eased slightly by Increasing\nUM tax on Halooni and on the production of\niilcohollo liquors, and by more rigid enforceme. t\nof the law in such respects, though It is impossible\nto hope fir much from this source. Th\u00ab saloons\nhere are h.i poverty stricken as arf\u00bb the people\nwhile the only liquors produced are what i 9 known\nas \"chics,\" the native \u2022\u25a0\u0084,.... and a native whlta\nrum. fairly good In quality, but by force of ctr\nciMiiHtHncea small In quantity and marketed at an\nextremely low figure. The Imposition of a tax on\npersonal property would avail nothing, as, asld\u00bb\nfrom a very few people, the Panamans have no\nproperty worth assessing; nor Is It possible to add\nvery much to the revenues by Increasing th\u00ab tax\non real estate, for to tax It much heavier than at\npre\u00ab\u00abnt would be to tax It out of the hands of It*\nowners.\nAfter explaining all of these facts and producing\nample proofs for their statements, the official* of\nth\u00ab government will very frankly admit that they\nart* In a quandary. It would be Impossible, of\nooursi), for them to pay expenses out of th\u00ab prin\ncipal payment for the. canal concessions until th\u00ab\npayment of the annual rental enriches the puhlla\ntreasury; but thl\u00bb they are loath to do. They are\ntoo long headed In a business way to deplete the\nonly a.^set they have, or are ever likely to have.\nIt would, too, be possible for them to float a loan\nafter tho establishment of the regular government;\nbut that Idea la not looked upon with favor for a\nloan would only Increase th\u00ab annual charge*\nagainst the government, and sooner or later tho\nprincipal would have to be paid.\nTo relieve her condition and extricate herself\nfrom this financial dilemma It la absolutely neces\nsary for Panama to have JiOOft,t>o. or thereabouts\nof the canal concession fee put out at Interest. It\nIs her only hope. This sum. If placed at 4 per\ncent, would, even after the republic goes to a gold\nbasis, afford It revenues ample for all !t> legiti\nmate requirements.\nThe Investment must be with th\u00bb United States\nend so secured by convention that the principal carl\nnever be. levied upon by the republic. Just now\nthe United States Is In the highest favor on the\nIsthmus. It would materially Increase the respect\nIn which she Is held, besides strengthening her con\ntrol and easing her solution of the police and other\nproblems appertaining to dominion over tha canal\nlone, If she should meet Panama half way in this\nmatter. By making herself the custodian of ejght\ntnnths of the canal concession fee she would ease\nthe financial strain upon the new republic, and,\nwhile keeping $S,m>i\\ooo In her pocket, Incur no\nobligation except for the annual payment of a\nreasonable interest.\nNO BILL AGAINST MERCANTILE TRUST.\nIt Was to Set Aside Sale of Boston Gas\nLight and Other Companies.\nBoston.

The kalection of the city Itself is not *.>\ntrreatly resetted, aside from the personal dis\ncomforts which it is feared will be experienced\nty those attending, but the motive of prompting\nit ts held to be open to eerious criticism.\nAs announced in The Tribune this morning,\nthe followers of Bfnafnr nor:r.an end other can\nfl^Btes. fearing a stampede for William R.\nHearEt, should the convention go to Chicago,\n\u25a0rorireu energetically to secure the vote neces\nsary to name St. Louis. In this they were sue- .\nftse.'ul, but they failed to take Into considera\ntion (ha eober second thought of the Democracy\nVlileh is now distinctly antagonistic to the deal.\nProminent Democrats in Washington, while they\nfcold that it would be obviously improper to\n(permit their names to be quoted, do not hesi\ntate to declare that the action of the Democratic\nKational Committee yesterday brought about\nkhe very result It was sought to avoid. They\nassert that it materially benefited the candidacy\n\u2022or Mr. Hearst, by giving it an importance not\nhitherto accorded It. They point out that the\njcomtry lias receive! the impression that the\n(Democratic party is afraid of Mr. Hearst, and\nBan away from a city supposed to be favorable\n|to his ambitions-. The action of the commit\ntee has produced a feeling of annoyance and\nfeser.tinern on the part of the Democrats in\nrwashingtor. for they believe that the party has\n(been placed in a false and ridiculous attitude\n\u25bathrough an 111-advised movement, and one cal\nculated to widen the breach between the Bryan\njaad anti- Bryan factions.\nThe leaders of the Democracy brought .along\n'With them to the committee meeting a large\n'.consignment of \"harmony.\" It-was conspicuous\nfly labelled and extensively advertised as a cure\n-all for Democratic Ills, and not a few were\n'\u2666'gold bricked\" Into partaking liberally of the\n'.remedy. After the announcement of the vote\njfor the convention city and en enlightenment as\n'to motives which led up to the selection, the\n\u25a0\"harmony\" label was removed and one bearing\n,the name \"Discord\" was substituted. The rush\nof customers for this article soon disposed of\n\u2022the entire stock, and a fresh supply was Im\n.mediately ordered to be be delivered nt Ft.

L.lchtenwalner was so\nbefuddled that it was with difficulty tnat the case\nwas carried to a conclusion, and the shabby old\ncourtroom was the scene of the. wellntgh un\nprecedented spectacle of a District Attorney, after\nhearing his own witnesses and calling several of\nthose originally putrmonfd by the other side, ask\ning for a verdict of \"not guilty.\" In the words of\nJudge Trexler from me bench, the prosecuting at\ntorney had succeeded in establishing an alibi for\nthe defence.\nSeveral times the court interfered and threatened\nto end the proceedings for the day unless the\nCommonwealth conducted its case in a more order\nly manner.

His hope\nwas that something might develop in the examina\ntion that would lead to a clew to the real murderer\nor murderers. Tho opening address of Mr. Lutz,\nwho is assisting thn District Attorney, was exceed\ningly brief, and did not indicate that the Common\nwealth expected to fasten complicity in th\u00ab mur\nder on Eckstein. Eight witnesses were called, but\nthe only point brought out was that Eckstein and\nthe girl frequently quarrelled, and that Eckstein Is\nalleged to have said to her:\n\"You are trying to drive me to the grave, but\nyou may get there before me.\"\nThis testimony was given by Mrs. Brobst. the\ndead girl's clutor. who said that she overheard the\nremark about Easter last year.\nDavid Welnenberger, who was acquitted yester\nday of complicity In the crime, refused to answer\nmany questions put to him with reference to ins re\nlations with tho cirl.\nThe examination of the last two witnesses called\nwas prolonged beyond all reasonable time.

In the \"Temps.\" the \"Journal dcs\nD^bats.\" the \"Libert*,\" the \"Matin.\" the \"Fi\ngar\u00ab.\\ \u25a0 the \"Gau'.Ms.\" \"Gil Bias.\" the Journal.\"\nthe \"Petit Jourr-il\" and in the leading papers of\nthe departments the idea, on the whole, comes as\na welcome solution in the present pacific tendency\nof th? Gallic spirit, for everywhere, except\namong a few redhot Nationalists, any notion of\nFrance being drawn into active intervention is\ndreaded as an awful calamity. Nevertheless,\nmoderate patriotic organs, such a\u00bb the \"Temps\"\nand the \"Journal dcs Debnta\" refrain from urg\ning France's great and beloved ally, the Emperor\nof Russia, to take the initiative, and The Trib\nune's suggestion, is published without comment.\nThe true gist of French opinion is set forth in\nthe conversation I had to-day with the French\napostle of arbitration and the French delegate\nto th\u00ab Hague Tribunal, Baron d'Estournelles de\nConstant. Deputy of the Sarthe, who made the\nfollowing statement:\nWe must not expect too much from the Hague\nCourt. Its creation is still recent, and yet last\nyear and the year before all the European pow\ners, France included, were more or less hostile\nlo the court and tried to boycott it. It Is only\nthe prudent initiative of the United States that\nhas saved the Hague Court from that tacit\nhostile coalition, but President Roosevelt, in do\ning so when ha sent before the court the case\nof the Pious Fund of California, took great care\nto choose that case among the small and merely\nfinancial foreign difficulties of his government.\nHe would never have begun with a big polittcal\naffair, and if another government had advised\nhim to follow a different line he would have\ncertainly refused to li.-ten to it.\nIt is the same with Russia. . for Russia un\ndoubtedly considers her difference with Japan a3\na national one. and that is why I think it would\nbe useless to advise her to brlJr.K it before th*\nHague Court, but if Russia is. not prepared to\ngo to The Hasrue she cannot forget the Hague\nConvention, which may give to her, as well as\nto Japan, important facilities, for the settlement\nof their conflict. For instar\u00bb - e. it has been de\ncided by Article 111 thav every civilized power is\nmorally bound to offer her bons offices. Very\nlikely England has already offered her bons of\nfices to Japan, and it may be that France, In\naccordance with the universal pacific feeling of\nopinion, has tendered the same to her ally. Rus\nsia.\nI am afraid nothing more can be done now.\nLet us l*\u00bbgin, as President Roosevelt has done,\nwith small cases. As fur the great questions,\nlet us try to settle them with th? resources of\nthe bons offices.\nAdrier. Hobmr<l. E.litor\u00bbof the \"Temps.\" when\nconsulted on the subject, declined to express an\nopinion, considering the matter, In view of the\nFrench alliance with Russia, too delicate for\nFrance to take the initiative In such a proposal.\nM. Perivler. Editor of \"Cril Bias,\" approved\ngenerally The Tribune's suggestion, but ex\npressed confidence that war would be averted.\nand deprecated the manoeuvres of Stock Ex\nchange speculators, who seemed to be using all\ntheir efforts to precipitate a conflict.\nSenator Saint-Germain, when asked for hi 3\nviews on the subject, said:\nIt would be a splendid thins if the Hague\nTribunal should give a pacific solution of the\nRusso-Japanese difference. The Emperor of\nRussia has a?stinied the title of Emperor of\nPeace, and utilizing the Hagne Tribunal would\nbe an excellent opportunity to Justify such a\ntitle. If Nicholas II would only manifest a de\nsire to refer the dispute to The Hague Japan\nwould be compelled to submit to such arbitra\ntion, and this would terminate the matter peace\nfully. Otherwise the dispute may have far\nreaching consequences.\nFirm confidence prevails here that the dis\npute betwee.i Russia and Japan will be settled\namicably by giving: Japan predominance in\nCorea and by Russia observing the. open door\ntreaties In Manchuria.

In\ntending to speak only a moment. Mr. Spooner\nquickly -warmed to his subject, while Senator\nDepew politely waited for him to conclude his\nremarks. When It became obvious that the\nSens tor from Wisconsin was petting: well under\nway for a speech of several hours, a note was\n\u2022ent to him by Senator Aldrlch. calling his at\ntention to the fact that Mr. Depew was sched\nuled for a epeecft.

He conceded that the\nPresident had not been bound, because a rea\n\u00bb\u00a9nable time- had not elapsed, to turn from the\nPanama to the Nicaragua route. He also as\ntented to the proposition that the United State*\nbad a grievance against Colombia 0:2 account of\nthe rejection of the Hay-Herran treaty.

He engaged\nIn a controversy with Mr. Fpooner as to the\nguarantee of the right of transit. He said he\nwas willing to admit that the spirit of the treaty\nnf 1846 calls for the building of the canal, but\neven with that construction Colombia's refusal\nto allow the building of the canal would not\nhave been cause tor war or for the landing of\nAmerican troops in Panama. He also com\nplained that the President had prematurely\nrecognized Panama. The established methods of\nfliplcmacy were ignored, and immediate and\nprompt trmtd intervention and a display of\nforce were made, without complying with the\nformal procedure required by international law.\n\"Had these, outrages been committed,\" Mr.\nNewlands added, \"by the Executive en a great\npower like England or Russia or Germany, Con\ngress would promptly disavow them: and shall\nthe impotence of Colombia disqualify her from\nreceiving satisfaction for injury inflicted on her\nKr the unauthorized and unconstitutional action\nof this country's Chief Executive?\"\nMr. Spooner congratulated Mr. Newlaads on\nwhit he called an espousal of the doctrine of in\nternational eminent domain.

Jan. 30.\u2014 Senator Gorman pre\nsentfd for the consideration of his party eel\nleagues in a caucus held to-day, at which a>\nspecial Injunction of secrecy was issued to all\npresent, two schemes which he believes may\nadd considerably to the embarrassment ot the\nadministration, and possibly even result hi that\nact of warfare on the part of Colombia whhdl\nis the remaining source of hope of the anti\ncanal faction !n the Senate.\nMr. < lor man's pet scheme is the passage of the\nresolution, calling for an investigation bg>\ntho Committee on Foreign Relations of the ru\nmor that Mr. Bunau-Varilla or other people h\u00bb\nthe I'nited States promoted or contributed to\nthe Panama revolution. It was argued in the\ncaucus to-day that the passage of this resolu\ntion must result in an investigation which could\neasily be prolonged for the greater part of the\npresent session and almost until the opening of\nthe eaasaahj\u00dfb It would afford an opportunity\nfor the introduction of the most sensational evi\ndence, which, although it might be disproved,\nwould be allowed to \"leak out\" to the press and]\nwould inevitably produce some effect, and pos\nsibly save to the Democrats a few votes. It\nwould put the administration to considerable\nembarrassment, because it would become neces\nsary to sammon witnesses, probably from as far\naway as Panama, to disprove th* evidence which\nthe opposition would be able to introduce.\nThis resolution was the chief topic of debate\nin the caucus, and it appealed strongly to the*\nGorman- Bailey faction, and. were there any\naaaahkussa of unity in the Democratic ranks.\nSenator Stones resolution might have been\nadopted as a party measure. There were, how\never, a number of Democrats present who ap\nj.reiiated that .-.uch a course, doomed to inev\nitable ultimate exposure, would bring down on\nthem the censure of their constituents, and they\nhel 1 back in sufficient numbers to make it Im\npossible to adopt the Stone resolution by a two\nthirds vote and thus bind the party In the\nSenate.\nDefeated in his attempt to put through this\nmischievous programme. Mr. Gorman then\nturned his attention to his second scheme. This\nwas the adoption as a party measure of the\nBacon resolution. It does not present such a>\nwealth of mischief making power, but Mr. Bacon\nadvanced the idea that it might rob the admin\nistration of the credit of negotiating any treaty\nwjth Colombia which would remove all aorenesa\nfrom the diplomatic relations of the two coun\ntries and that would be a step In the Jastut,\ndirection. The Gorman- Bacon programme, how\never, was. met with an argument suggested by\nSenator Spooner. who yesterday penned an\nironical summary of the Bacon raaohltlan and\npassed tt around the Senate Chamber. It read:\nWhereas. The United States took no part tn\nbringing about the revolution in Panama and la tn\nno wise responsible for the same: therefore, be it\nResolved.

The gunboat turned her searchlight on\nthe caaees, and it showed that each boat car\nried as n'.iiny Indians as i-ouU possibly crowd\nin. probaMy two hundred in all. All the men\nwere armed with bows and arrows, guns of\nquaint old pattern and other weapons. Their\nfans were besmeared with paint. There is no\ndoubt that their Intentions were hostile. They\nhoped to reach and surprise the ship.\nThe commander of the Bancroft ordered th\u00ab\nKunboat cleared for action, and her guns were\nloaded and trimmed ready for use. A quick\nfiring Colt gun was placed near the gangway,\nand orders were given to the gunners of this\npiece to keep up a ceaseless fire all around the\ncanoes.\nAs soon as the- Tndians heard this rain of bul\nlets they immediately began retreating toward\nthe shore. The gunners werr ordered not to\nfire, at the Indians, so the briilet3 cut the air\nand churned up the water around them.

I\ncannot speak for the Governor, but it strikes\nme that he is not very fully in accord with the\nmain features of the Xewcomb bill.

Th\u00ab Mayor called\nthe conference In his office at the request of Mr.\nHayes, and after It was over the Mayor paid\nhe had requested both th\u00bb Firs Commissioner\nand the Health Commissioner to hay\u00ab\u00bb examina\ntions made of all the theatres in the five bor\noughs of the city. He also had requested the\npresidents of the boroughs to have their super\nintendents of buildings make reports about the\ntheatres and other places of amusement In th*\nseveral boroughs, regarding the manner In\nwhich such buildings comply or fail to comply\nwith the building laws.\nThe 'inspection of the theatres by order of\nFire oCmcnfMi r r Hayes is ;.lr*\u00bbadly partly\ncompleted, and the reports of that inspection\nwill deal chiefly with asbestos curtains, exits\nand heating and lighting :i(?e!rent\u00df.

It\nmay be several days before the sanitary of\nficials can complete such an investigation.\nWhen the reports are received, if it is found\nthat a theatre Is unsafe by reason of failure to\ncomply with the lire, sanitary and building\nregulations, the Mayor may take steps to close\nit until the place is made safe.\n\"When 1 receive the reports,\" Mayor McClellan\ncaM yesterday, \"I shall take such action as will\nprevent any violation of the law at the theatres\nIn the future, and stop any that is discovered.

He told Mr. Thompson to have th\" reports\non the theatres ready at the earliest possible\nminute.\nFire Commissioner Hayes said In the after\nnoon that be had received a special report from\nForeman Lenihan regarding the asbestos cur\ntains in theatres in Manhattan. Th\u00ab report says\nthat all the theatres have asbestos curtains\nwhich appear to be fireproof and in good work\ning order except the Orpheus Music Hall, at No.\n125 Bast One-hundredf-and-twenty-liflh-st; tha\nCircle Theatre, at Broadway and Slxtleth-st..\nand Huber's Museum, at No. 10<j East Four\nteenth-st. The Commissioner Bald he had not\ntaken any st3p to dose those places of amuse\nment whl<-h had do asbestos curtains for the\nstage, as he did not know that he had the power\nto take such action, but he was willing to let the\npublic know of the lack of safety at those places.\nThe Mayor yesterday asked Police Commis\nsioner llcAdoo to have two additional police\nmen stationed in es h theatre during each per\nformance. One of the policemen is to stay in\nthe balcony and the Other In the gallery, and\nthey will :\u2022\": \u2022\" expected to see that there is no\nblocking of th<* stairways or aisles or over\ncrowding of the lobbies.

The government Is, not a personal\nmachine. Our Presidents have been great and\nsuccessful, not by dominating their party, bat\nby conducting their administration in harmony\nwith party sentiments. Then, when party sen\ntiment baa approved wise, and successful poli\ncies, they have taken their places in the list of\ngreat men.\nWHY CLEVELAND FAILED.\nThe history of Mr. Cleveland la a perfect 11\nlustration of my point.

The Americas\npolicy is not one of conquest or of paramount\npolitical Influence, It does not ask special con\nsideration. It asks no more than an equal ritrht\nfor th.-> American people to trade In the world's\nmarkets, and It opposes the policy of any nation\nwhich, going outside of its own territory, under\ntakes to set up metes and bounds within which\nIts p -ople can trade.\nour entrance Into world politics. if so larpe\nan expression be descriptive, has been eyed\nby the other nations In a spirit of hearty friend\nship They have the assurance of our physical\nsituation that It can have no ulterior purpose.\nbut it brings to us as members of Congress\nnew questions and new responsibilities, and I\ntake It to be a great privilege to be a member\nof the House or the Senate at this time in our\ncountry's development The necessity of new\nmarkets and better commercial facilities was\nfelt by the people long: before it appeared In\ngovernment policies. The construction of an\nIsthmian canal transcends In importance any\nother act of legislation or diplomacy to which\nthe government can commit itself, and the peo\nple will look impatiently, In my opinion, at any\nindividual OT political party that seeks to em\nbarrass this work with partisan outcries. If\nthis session of Congress accomplishes nothing\nels- than to render possible the Immediate con\nstruction of the canal across the isthmus, it\nwill have done enough to entitle it to a hisch\nplace in the list of useful and memorable ses\nsions. .\nCARNEGIE MEN PROTEST AT CUT.\nFittsburg.

The Senator ashed th^m if\nthe people of New-York desired to brint? about\na condition of affairs sack as existed In Mr.\nCleveland's second administration, and they re\nplied that the Senate was safely Republican .mi\na Democratic administration cosJd do no harm.\nThe Senator says his reply was somethlSSJ like\nthis:\n\u2022 Gentlemen, i think I may safely assume that,\nIf you Insist upon electing \u2022 Democratic Presi\ndent, you win at th\u00bb same time elect a Demo\ncratic House of Representatives; It requires a\nchange of only fifteen seats m the Hoose to do\nthis. Now, in this situation it weald be as\nmore than natural to expect the passage by the\nHouse of a tariff bill embodying th\u00bb traditional\npolicy of the Democrats in favor si a tariff for\nrevenue only.\n\u2022A Republican Senate saved you from yaw\non a similar occasion, when Mr. < - i\u00bbve!artii\nwas President for the first ttmo.

Dubois and Carmack, but\nthey have persisted in their belief that the ad\nministration could be embarrassed and the coun\ntry won in the election of next year by the de\nfeat of the Panama treaty until to-day, when\nactual count revealed the fact that the Repub\nlicans could rely on sixteen Democratic votes in\nsupport of the canal convention.\nThe declaration of Mr. Olney for the candi\ndacy of ex- President Cleveland, made In New-\nYork last night, proved another source of sorrow\nto the Democrats in both houses of Congress.\nThere is probably no class of men who would be\nso unwilling to nee the former President a candi\ndate as the politicians of his own party, and,\nentirely aside from the chagrin of Senator Gor\nman at seeing the strength of his oldtime enemy.\nth\u00ab rank and file ot the Democrats in Congress\nwere seriously disturbed at Mr. Olney's declara\ntion.

The opinion iva? a\nJong one. and is said to establish a precedent.\nThe effect of the decision Is that a man Is not\nan actual member of Congress from the time of\nhit \u2022lection until he takes the oath at the bar\nof the bouse to which he is elected, and that he\nIs not amenable to the law as a member of Con\ngress and officer of the United States In that in\nterval.\nDi*irlct Attorney Summers entered a nolle\n\u00a3ro\u00abe<jul in the other cases against the Senator\n\u00abnd Postmaster Jacob Fisher, of Hastings, Neb..\n\u25a0with the statement that the construction placed\non the law by the court precluded further pro\nceedings against either Senator Dietrich or Mr.\nr l*Ler. both of whom were discharged.\nOn account of a statement made to the press\ntorn* time ago on behalf of Senator Dietrich, to\n\u25a0she effect that he did not wish to take advan\ntage of any technicality, but v.anted the case\ntried on Its merits. In order that he might be\nfully vindicated. Genera] Cowln, Senator Diet\nrich's chief counsel, to-day gave out a state\nment of his reasons for demurring to the in\ndictment*. In effect it was that, as the court\nItself would insist on an adjudication of the\nquestion whether Mr. Dietrich were a United\nPtatei Senator during the period covered by the\nalleged unlawful acts. General Cowln decided\nthat the demurrer should be Interposed before\nthe taking of testimony should begin. He ex\nplained that otherwise the court, at the close\nof the case for the prosecution, would raise the\npoint In question, which would preclude the de\nfence from presenting any evidence in refuta\ntion of the testimony introduced by the prosecu\ntion.\nV.'hen General Cowln'a statement was shown\nto District Attorney Summers he said:\nThe answer to that statement Is this: Official\nly this office has nothing to pay; the court has\nsettled the matter. If Senator Dietrich desired\nto secure a vindication through a trial of the\ncase on its merits, he had an opportunity to do\n\u00bb-o by not raising the technical point of whether\nor not h* was a member of Congress from the\ntime of his election to his taking the oath of\noffice.\nDRTGGS CASE DIFFERENT.\nflayers Think Acquittal of Senator\nDietrich Will Not A feet It.\nMany friends of ex-Conjressman Edmund H.\nDrlggi. the Democratic politician convicted in\nBrooklyn on Thursday of having violated the fed\neral Jaw ln accepting compensation for Retting con\ntracts with the Postofflce Department for a private\nconcern, read with interest yesterday of the order-\nIng cf a verdict of not guilty In the case against\nUnited State* Senator Dietrich of Nebraska by\nJudge Van Devanter in Omaha.

The fact that ln each\ndormitory, throughout the night, an officer is\nstationed on a dais also tends to lessen the\nchinee of any possible surprise by fire in this\ndirection. Instant communication between the\nsuperintendent's office and officer* who may be\nscattered throughout the Refuge Is also estab\nlished by rr.eana of telephone and electric call\nbells.\nOu'^-de the buildings *re several fresh water\nhydrants, in addition to one with salt water\npressure, invaluable not only because of Its in\ncreased pressure, but because It means that at\nWst one out.\u00abide pipe will he slow to freeze.\nThe regular fireboat alarm Is also available in\ncase of emergency.\nIn Mrs. Dummy's division of the Island, which\nincludes the Infants 1 Hospital, Children's Hos\npital, North and South Hospitals, Reception\nBuilding.

Here the lire\nforce is about thirty ftroiig, composed entirely\nof employes, who drill three or four times a\nmonth. Naturally, its efficiency rests on a\nsomewhat different plane from that of the lire\nbrigade of the House of Refuge.\nTh\u00bb buildings of both divisions, with the ex\nception of smaller pavilions, are constructed\nmainly of F.tone or brick, yellow pine, however,\nbeing largely used In the flooring.\nIn the oaee of a tire in either division, the su\nperintendents co-operate. In Mrs. Dunphy'a di\nvision there is a periodic tire alarm test.

Jan. 15.\u2014 1t Is hoped that the\nconsideration of the Panama Canal treaty by\nthe Foreign Relations Committee will be com\npleted in a few days, after which it will be\ntaken up in the Senate. Senator Gorman to\nday proposed amendments to the set of resolu\ntions offered by him which render them. In the\nopinion of leading Republicans, entirely in\nnocuous, so that they are likely to be adopted\nat an early date. This change is regarded as\nInrgely in the nature of a retreat on the part\nof the Senator from Maryland, who probably\nhas finally come to appreciate how entirely un\ntenable is his opposition to the Panama treaty.\nOnce the treaty is reported to the Senate the\nrublic debate will cease. Almost continuous\nexecutive sessions will be held, and final ratifi\ncation is not likely to be seriously delayed. The\ndebate of the last week is re'gaxded as having\ncleared the atmosphere and prepared the way\nfor ratification, and once more the prospect of\na comparatively early adjournment Is being dis\ncussed.\nPAX AM A W THE SENATE.\nSpooner and Tillman Have Another\nLively Colloquy.\nWashington. Jan. 15.\u2014 After the passage of a\nnumber of minor measures to-day, tna Gorman\nPanama resolution wap laid before the Senate. Mr.\nGorman offered a number of amendments, striking\nout the word \"Intervention\" wherever it appears,\nthus modifying the resolution so as to make it an\ninquiry of the President concerning the use of\nAmerican military forces in the Isthmus of Pan\nama.\nMr. Cullom. in view of the amendments, withdrew\nhis motion to refer the resolution to the Committee\non Foreign Relations, and said he was willing to\nhave a vote on it.\nMr. Lodge, however, asked to have the resolu\ntion, as amended, printed, and lie over for an\nother day. and that order was made.\nMr. Teller then spoke on the Panama question,\nsayiug he believed it should be treated from a non\npartisaa point of view. H\u00ab thought, however, that\nwhenever the President transcended his duty the\nfact should be pointed out. In the present instance\nhe did not doubt the good intentions of tha Presi\ndent, but he distrusted of his wisdom in what he\nhad done. His objection was not. he said, based\non any fear of war with Colombia, because Co\nlombia had shown that she was too wise to enter\ninto a conflict of arms with the United States. He\nhad no complaint to make against Panama, for he\nthought the people of that country had the right\nto revolt. Indeed, he thought if he had lived in\nPanama he would have been a rebel himself. Thla\nright of the Panamans did not, however, alter the\nduty of the United States to remain neutral. He\nasserted that a new State coming into existence by\nsecession should be recognised only when It had\nestablished its capacity to maintain its indepen\ndence. There should be no interference so long as\nthere was a likelihood of the success of the parent\nState. This rule. Mr. Teller dtclared, had not been\nni<\u00a3 in Panama.\nMr. Platt. of Connecticut, asked whether under\nany circumstances the United States had a right\nto protect transit across the Isthmus, but Mr.\nTeller declared that the question was academic and\nsaid he would not argue the case on that general\nground. He was willing to discuss the right to\ninterfere as the President had done, and was\nready to contend that his interference was in con\ntravention of international law.\nWhen Mr. Teller referred to Mr. Tlllman's char\nacterization of the situation on the isthmus, the\nlatter interrupted to say that he had been mis\nunderstood and desired to explain. He meant to\nsay that it would have been preferable for the\nUnited States to tell Colombia to get on* the isth\nmus entirely than for us to \"pursue there the\nmethods of the sneak thief and maintain the atti\ntude of a bully.\"\nIn response to a Suggestion made by Mr. Teller,\nMr. Spooncr interrupted to say that by tfte treaty\nof 1546 Colombia was bound to maintain the per\npetual right of the United States to passage across\nthe isthmus and he argued that that right re\nmains, even though Colombia dors not etand be\nhind it.\nMr. Teller admitted that any right the United\nStates had under Colombia she still had under\nPanama, if Panama was an established power. He\nthen asked tor an opinion from Mr. Spooner con\ncerning \"the new theory Jof International eminent\ndomain.\" and tho latter replied that \"he had not\nyet been able to jdvo his assent to that doctrine,\"\nwhich, as he understood it, meant that when a\nweak nation had what .1 strong nation needed\nthe latter mieht take it l>y means of arms if neces\nsary. Yet it must be remembered that right of\nway of one landowner over lamd owned by another\nperson Is a. right recognized by the world. \"If.\"\nhe eaid. \"there is a doctrine of the private way of\nnecessity, are we to pay that there is not an inter\nnational way of necessity where the interest of the\nworld is concerned?\" -\nThere were interruptions at this point, causing\nMr. Tillman to remark that \"It taken a gr\u00ab3t\nmany doctors to bring about the birth of this\nbaby.\"\n\"I'll try to take care of my own baby,\" respond\ned Mr. Spooner. \"and when I can't do that I will\nask some member of my own family to do so.\"\nThe colloquy caused a general outburst of laugh\nter. After it had FUbsided Mr. Spooner continued\nhis statement, saying he was willing to confess\nthat he had not reached a conclusion In his own\nmind. \"I am not willing to concede the rifrhr of\nInternational eminent domain, but I can't find it\nin my heart to deny it.\" h\u00ab paid.\nMr. Teller look issue with the President's dec\nlaration that the course pursued in Panama had\nteen in the interest of ''collective civilization.\"\nThat, he said, was a dangerous doctrine, and was\nJust Fueh a doctrine as Russia might apDeal to if\nFhe should attempt to crush Japan. The doctrine\nwas not Americar. ; It was contrary to all the best\ntraditions of this country. It was the doctrine that\nmight makes right. He discussed the government\nof Panama, declaring it to be unrepublican 'n\nform, and was interrupted by Mr. Spooner. who\nsaid that it had been a \"mooted question as to\nwhether there is a republican form of government\nin Colorado.\"\n\"If.\" responded Mr. Teller, \"there is not a re\npublican form of government in Colorado, there is\na Republican administration there.\"\nWhen Mr. Teller ceased speaking, the Senate\npassed a large number of private pension bills and\nadjourned until Monday.\nORGANIZING IN PANAMA.\nConstitutional Convention Meets \u2014\nGood Feeling Shown.\nPanama.

It is said Hiat further\ninformation concerning th\u00ab conditions at Panama\nand Colon as to the harbors may render the amend\nment unnecessary.\nUnder the treaty the harbors are not Included\nin the grant to this government, and the point has\nbeen raised that the Republic of Panama ha 3 the\npower to adopt regulations which might interfere\nwith the free operation of the shippln? ot the\nworld.\nTho Republican members of the committee are\ninclined to favor a few minor amendments, if only\nfor the purpose of brinsrlng about ratit'ostion of\nthe convention b\" the Constitutional Convention of\nthe new republic, and thu* meet and dispose of\none of the vigorously fought contentions of the\nDemocrats that tne tr*atv ha\u00ab not been ratified by\na tangible form of government.\nTHE CONVENTION CALL\nContinued from first pafa.\nvanced to show why its immediate issue is be\ncoming imperative.

If these are his majesty's\nviews there will be no war. The question rests\nwith him. Japan ha* nothing: further to say.\nThe minister added that he had received a dis\np4ftch' from Toklo denying- the staterafent that\nJapan was trying to induce Corea to recognize a\nJapanese protectorate.\n\"It Is practically certain that any declaration\nof war \u25a0will not emiinate from Russia,\" said\nBaron Hayashi in an interview earlier in the\nday. The minister was not very hopeful of the\nresult of the latest Japanese note, but he spe\ncifically denied that Japan's reply suggests the\nneutralization of a part of Manchuria as well\nas a part of Corea, or that mention ia made of\nthe right to break off negotiations. He added:\nCur conditions are practically summed up In\nthe concluding portion of the Stats Depart\nment's announcement regarding the Cblno-Amer\nican treaty.

Con\nservative opinion holds that, while the prospect\nof peace is better than ever, the end cannot be\npredicted with certainty, particularly the man\nner in which a settlement can be obtained.\nThe Intimation received here that President\nRoosevelt is selecting consuls to represent the\nUnited States at Moukden and An-Tunj?, in\nManchuria, the ports opened to commerce by\nthe recently ratified treaty between the United\nStates and China, was received as a matter of\ncourse.\nContinuing Its anti-war campaign, the \"Russ\"\nto-rtay predicts that, even granting that Russia\nis victorious, there will be subsequent inter\nference on the part of other powers aud a \"new\nedition of the Berlin Congress.\"\nJAPAN'S NEW SHIPS LEAVE SUEZ.\nThe Kasaga Closely Followed by the Nisshin\non the Voyage to the Far East.\nSuez.

Murphy served notice on\nChief Judge Alton B. Parker that if he wished\nto secure the support of Tammany he must\ncome out in the open and repudiate David B.\nHill. Dwelling on the sorry figure cut by Judge\nParker' as a result of his timidity in allowing\nthe use of his name nt the last Democratic con\nvention, declaring that the general impression\nwas that Judge Parker must either be a weak\nman or entirely under the domination of ex-\nSenator Hill, this Democratic leader Invited\nJudge Parker to \"spaas for himself.- He said:\nIs Senator Hill Judge Parkers authorized\nWarwick? Why did h\u00bb let Mr. HIU unreservedly\nshape his JesU'llea si the convention of IMS\nif he were not? If ac hopes for the support of\nTammany he must esped to declare for us and\nnot for Hill. The Weal is hostile to Hill\nhow will they regard a man who, at a critical\ntime, allowed Hill entirely to dominate his ..pin\nions and counteract his sense of duty to his\nparty? Senator afcCarren believed at the time\nof that convention that he had a tentative ac\nceptance of a nomination from Judge Parker.\nThere was a letter, so the rumor goes, making\nthe matter even more d* finite. Wcere dM the\nletter go and who suppressed it. and why did\nJudge Parker submit to thai suppression?\nThere was \"Hilly\" Sheehan. He was at that !\nconvention for Judge Parker first and last. H*\ncame away disheartened, discouraged Why did i\nJudge Parker dodge the issue? We knew that I\nhe was stronger in the country. We Tammany I\nmen knew that he would even poll as many\nvotes in the city as Coler. What was his ex\ncuse? His friends said financial reasons, but\nany one know? that, even if he had resigned\nfrom the bench, and had been defeated, he could\nhave come to New-York and made SMMM6 a\nyear In private practice. Is that a sensible ex\nplanation?\nNow, there are people coming from the West\nwho want to size up this man Parker. If he\nwill break away from the alleged friendly re\nlations with David R Hill, himself a candidate\nfor the Presidency since time immemorial, there\nmay be some hope for him. But will he? Has\nhe go\u00bb the sand, or is he a weak man? That's\nwhat we want to know, and we have got to\nbe informed.\nTHE HILL, AND TAMMANY STORY.\nHardly less interesting in regard to Hill than\nParker Is this striking expression of the Tam\nmany position. It would seem to settle definite\nly the notion that Hill has crawled hack into\nthe good graces of Tammany. It puts before\nthe country a fair promise of disruption In the\nState if Tammany is opposed. The familiar cry\nthat Judge Parker is an unknown quantity Is\nraised again, and the alleged candidate finds\nhimself placed in the difficult position of having\neither to discard a friend or to lose the support\nof his own State, without which he cannot be\nseriously regarded as a candidate.\nThe ultimatum called forth an Interesting\ncomment from Charles N. Bulger. He declared\nearnestly that \"there was no difference between\nMr. Murphy and Mr. Hill on the subject of the\nPresidential nomination.\" He did not add that\nthere was any agreement. But the fact is be\ncoming more and more apparent here that it Is\nMr. Hill's friends who are declaring that the ex-\nSenator ha* no hard feelings toward Mr. Mur\nphy. The Tammany leader's friends do not credit\nMr Murphy with any such fraternal sprit tow\nard Hill.\nEx-Lieutenant Governor William F. Sheehan\nkeeps constantly In touch with Judge Parker\nthese days, nnd files off to New- York at inter\nvals on mysterious missions, but there is no\nreason to doubt now that a Tammany Senator\nhas spoken his opinion, and that of the organ\nization, that Judge Parker will be asked to de\nclare his hand.\nEx-Senator Hill sat in his law office this after\nnoon and read the account of the Tammany Sen\nator's deliverance. Like Judge Parker, he never\ncomments, never answers, never says a word\nfor publication. In the present instance he fol\nlowed his usual course. So did Judge Parker.\nThat William K. Hearst Is rapidly displacing\nJudge P;irker In the attention of the country\nwas another startling assertion of one well\nknown Democratic Senator, who ilatl>- suggest\ned that space rates were securing the support\nof many national Democrats. The real danger\nof the Hearst talk, according to this Senator,\nwas that presently it would be taken seriously\nin other parts of the country, particularly If the\nParker boom continued to flatten out at It 3 pres\nent rate.\nGOIN'O TO SIZE IP PARKER.\nThere was a rumor afloat to-night that the\nfirst of the Western Democrats who are planning\nto come to Albany and tag* a look nt Judge\nParker for the purpose of getting a true esti\nmate <-f his calibre as Presidential timber was\nexpected shortly. Thomas Taggart. National\nCommltteeman from Indiana, was reported to be\ncoming. From another quarter this report was\ndenied, and it is extremely doubtful If Taggart\nwill come.\nMeanwhile.

Jan. 14.\u2014 startling and apt\nparentry authentic rumor Involving treachery to\nPresident Roosevelt. if not to the national com\nmittee itself, on the part of the executive com\nmittee of that organization was in circulation\nat the Capitol to-day. From sources usually\nregarded as trustworthy came the Information\nthat the reason lor the unprecedented delay In\nissuing the call for the Republican National\nConvention was due to an effort on the part of\nthe executive com nittee to find an excuse lor ao\naltering the call as to preclude the possibility of\nselecting delegates for the respective Congress\ndistricts and to make necessary Instead the>\nelection of all delegates \"at large.\"\nThe delay in Itself is already the occasion of\nsurprise and annoyance to numerous ?tate or\nganizations, and unless the call Is issued lrr.\nn'.\u00bb-fliately serious inconvenience must ensue: but\nthe proposition to change the form of the call\nand defeat the desire of the party that the usual\nniethod of selecting delegates he pursued will, if\ncarried out. create widespread indignation.\nSuch a proposition is characterized with reser-*\nvation as an attempt to control certain delega\ntions which would normally cast their votes far\nthe President in the forthcoming convention,\nant!.

There Is\nevery reason to believe that not only the lead\ners, but the rank and file of the party, would\nresent such an attempt to defeat the popular\nwill, and would seek redress in one form or an\nother.\nPostmaster General Payne, vice-chairman oC\nthe National Committee, declared to-day that\nthere could be no truth in the rumor, because^\nhe. as vice-chairman, had heard nothing of It.\nOn the other hand, it is maintained that other\"\nmembers of the committee would readily appre-i |\nciite the delicate position in which they would\nplace Mr. Payne by Informing him of such a*\nplan, and would naturally refrain from taking\nhim Into their confidence while he remained a*\nmember of Mr. Roosevelt's Cabinet.\nSufficient importance is attached to the rumoil\nto cause Senator Penrose to withhold the call\nfor the Pennsylvania State Convention, and the*\ncall, already prepared, but not sent out. stilt\nHas on the desk of Major Andrews, secretary\nof the Republican State Commit MeanwMla\nSenator Pen rose has ordered a complete search\nof th\" proceedings of Republican conventions,\nand has gone to Philadelphia to-night, presuma\nbly to consult Senator Quay and other leaders\nof the party in his State.\nIt is now five weeks since the meeting el th<*\nNational Committee, and no call for the Na\ntional Convention has been Issued, although\nSenator Manna has received numerous messages)\nand letters from party loaders in all parta of\nthe country urging expedition.\nPostmaster General Payne explains that, al\nthough such delay is entirely unprecedented, tha\ncall hiving been issued within a weak \u2022 m a'!\nprevious occasions, it Is perfectly natural, si\nChairman Hanna and Secretary Heath hive\nbeen very busy. The Postmaster General fur\nther avers that the call i? merely a formality\nand of no vital Importance.\nSome of the President's most earnest support\ners, however, do no: take this view of the case.\nThey ?ay that the course of the Pennsylvania\nRepublicans in calling, as they expect to. ths\nState Convention in advance of the issue of thi\u00bb\nnational call, is irregular, and. were there a rival\nfaction in the field, mi\u00a3ht lead to the calling ef\n\u25a0 subsequent convention, the selection of a, \u25a0\u00ab\u2022\u2022\nond delegation and a contest which would be\ndecided by the more powerful element In th-\u00bb\nNational Convention, while the virtue of beingf\nthe more regular would He with the delegation\nselected pursuant to the national call.
