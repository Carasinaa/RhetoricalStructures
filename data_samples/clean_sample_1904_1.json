In one word, Japan at the present moment stands for the open door In China. The lat ter, with its teeming population -f over four hundred million pe pie, is the most valuable market on the face of the globe to every nation josstased of manufacturing and commercial in terests. Countries whose prosperity is derived to Fich an extent from their trade as the United Btiites, Great liritnin, Germany, Italy and France cannot afford to submit with equanim ity to the prospect of the principal rr.arkets of China bii. barred to their industries. Noi c of them, however, are anxlou3 to take un anna acainst Russia or to ro to the length c f de cUrtric war upon her In order to keep these markets ocen. But they are all of them glad to find Japan disposed to undertake the work In their stead, and that Is why they are giving to her their sympathy nnd their moral support. To every i ne who has lived in the Orient and mho has acquired experience of the Asiatic character tl.o question must occur as to what skgree of dependence can be placed up.in tli ndertaking thai Corea, Manchuria and the rest f China will remain open to the trade of the United States arid of Europe, In the event of Japan obtaining control of the situation by Mans of a tual war, or perhaps, even, by more diplomatic pressure. True. Russia has a singu larly unfortunate record in the matter of the Don-fulfilment of official pled and treaty bllgaUona. There are few countries, however, Whose skirt nre absolutely unsoiled in this connection, and there is no guarantee whatso ever that Japan will not eventually follow In thla particular, too, the example set by so many Western powers, and decline to live up to her prssnftses. The morality of te Japanese mer el-ant in the matter of his obligations has long been a byword throughout the Orient, and BM frequently been denounced In consular reports r.d In looks of travel. It remains to be e.-u whether the Japanese government will manifest a loftier regard for Its promises, when the in terests of her merchants, of her manufacturers, aid, Indeed, of the prosperity of the satin land sf the Rising Sun. are at stake. Khould, then, Japan attempt to reserve the Chinese markets for her exclusive o . excluding therefrom all those Western powers which are n.w giving her that moral backing which is en couraging her to resist the advaa ea of the Kir - ' slahh. the situation will have become fraught with much greater dltli. uttfes than it Is to-day. Already the disposition of the hlncSS govern n.cnt and people to confide In the Japanere that Is to say, In fellow Ortentala and in fellow hithftis rather than In the Christian forelgn erais very marked. In the event of Japan ob taining the upper l.ai.d In her present conflict wUh Russia, her prestige and her lafluenos wr.uld Inevitably become to such an extent paramount in China that the latter would sub m'.t entirely to her guidance. a victorious Japan would undoubtedly lead to the organtxa tlon and mobilization of the Chines millions Irlo a vast and successful army. AVlth th. ir Similarity of race, religion, history, Ideals and customs, the Japanese and the Chinese might SjuSckty develop Into a military entity the power of Which, once aroused and mobilized, would dvarf Into Insignificance any horde of conquer ois tho tvorld baa ever seen. To-day the Japan en are Wining to be guided la a measure bj the sswnsela of the United States government, of Great Hritain and of other Western powers, It fcj doubtful whether she would continue to do so if she had all China behind her.

Under the clr cumstancf3 It cannot be too strongly urged that the United States, Great Britain and other West rn powers should Insist upon the most oxten Jve guarantees being furnished them by the Japanese that, if victorious in their conflict with Risla. they will not merely maintain the in- Irgrity of the Empire of China, but will keep t tatter's markets open to tie trade of the entire world.

In Corea there are several ports which Russia would fata have as outlets to her vast Inland empire. On the western coast there is Yongam bo, near the northern boundary, and a few piles from the mouth of the Yalu Rler. Here lhe Russians have leased a large tract of terri tory, and are now building forts, although they caid primarily they only wanted the land for cutting timber.

Che mulpo is to Seoul, the capital of Corea, what the harbor of Piraeus was to classic Athens. A railroad Joins Chemulpo and Seoul, and It Is through this port that the capital city carries on Its trade with China. A third port, and the most Important of all, is Fusan, on the Bouth r-.-it-tf-rii extremity of the peninsula, which la the southern terminal of the Pusan-Beoul Railroad, Fusan might be made a powerful naval station to control the straits between Corea and Japan. At th present time the Japanese government exercises a sort if commercial protectorate over this port and one of Russia's latest moves is to get the harbor Masnmpho, which is near l'usan. Port Lazaref, on the eastern shore of Oorea, crashed by that branch of the warm Japan cur rent which enters the Corean Strait, is still an- Oth r harbor which would permit Russia to have communication with the sea. summer and winter.

NEW-YORK TRIBUNE ILLUSTRATED SUPPLEMENT. THE COMMUTER'S HOME EN BUMMER. Shads trees, flowers, grassy lawns, room tar the children to romp ta without plajrlng hi Qm street I SUMMER AND WINTER IN THE SUBURBS. The Commuter Talks More About the Former tJuin He Does About the Latter Some Reasons. When the city man becomes discontented with his so many rooms and bath. and longs for the country, he should never take a suburbanite into his confidence. He will never obtain an un biassed opinion of country life by talking with a country resi lent. In the summer time he will find him full of boasts and In the winter full of explanations. The only way to get a genu ine, aboveboard, straightforward, unprejudiced conception of country life Is to visit a. suburban friend unexpectedly and see for one's self. Such a visit would better be made in the dead of winter than in midsummer. The commuter's statements regarding the beauties of nature In June and July contain a certain amount of truth that do not need Investigation by a de tective. Everybody knows that trees and grass grow in summer, and that they are pleasant to look upon. And yet the commuter always talks as if he were the first to discover that the country la pleasanter than the city in hot weather. When he eomel In from his rural home on a sultry morning and a.sks you how you slept la.st niht, you know, of course, that he slept all right him s.-lf. and that he only wants tlur c ortunity to say so. And wh-n ho gels the chance, lie will tell you how cool the nights ure at Slumber Corners, urid how the wind always circulates through that wonderful house of his, and how delightful Is the chirping of the crlcketa at night, and how healthful his cUMren are, how much they weigh, how much they eat, how much they look like him. and all because they can live iv the country. NO STEAM HEATED FLAT FOR HIM. the mtarbaa swnei contempt for city life often erta a Jar m winter, when the servant goes m strike, and ho has to tend Uxe furoa.ee and empty the ashes himself. When all other themes are exhausted, the suburbanite Is always ready to dilate on air. This subject of air Is especially dear to him, and offers a boundless field for his Intellect to dis port itself. He will tell you. to begin with, how much purer the air is in Slumber Corners than in New- York. Then again, Slumber Corners Is lio feet higher than New-York, a fact which proves that the air of Slumber Corners is dryer than that of New-York, and especially benefi cial for throat and lungs. Give him a change and he will tell how he once suffered from asth ma, catarrh, bronchitis, tonsUltls, laryngitis, with a threat of tuberculosis, before he left New-York for Slumber Corners. And should you suggest that his Manhattan ofhe, on the twentieth floor. Is even higher than the beauti ful hamlet wh-re he lives, he will tell you that New- York air is full of germs. In Slumber Cor ners germs cannot exist, although he may not say that Slumber Corners is too slow for gorms. If anything Is ev.-r said about the long ride on the ferry or the train the suburbanite Is ready with statistics to provt how rapidly he travels 1..i0k and forth each day. He has flg ored it all out to the fraction of a minute. If ho can shave an hour tewa one or two minutes he docs to. much as the storekeeper marks down his goods so as to remove the dollar sign. He telLs you it is only a six minute walk from his house to the station, that the train la an express. naJOttsj no stops, that it comes the nineteen rnlles between Slumber Corners and lioboken In thirty-five minutes, and that the terry makes the river trip tn fourteen inlut.a. The walk np from the station to the office takes only four minutes. And bo he figures that be mak s the entire journey in fifty-nine minute and adds, exultantly It's so much more convenient than The Bronx, where we once lived. Then it took me a wh.le hour. And should some Manhattanite ask him if the mosquitoes ever bother him. he always answers that Slumber Cornt-rs is wonderfully exempt from such a st, and that although all the rest of the State of New- Jersey may swarm with mosquitoes, they have never entered the Kden where he has his home. The screens in hi windows and doors and around his porch, he ex plains, are only to keep out Hies. With the coming of winter, however, the com muter grows less boastful. He is not so rady to exploit the remarkable virtues of Slumber Corners as formerly. When he comes into the office with his rubbers covered with mud, his overcoat wrinkled as if he had slept in it over night, and a thin veil of ashes on bis hat. he never calls anybody's attention to these details. And when a snowstorm sweeps down on the country and the river thickens with ice, and he gets down to the office two hours' late, he merely answers inquiries by saying that he missed the train, or that there was a change La the schedule, or that the baby wasn't well, and he wanted to have talk with the doctor. Should the city mxm. however, make his coun try friend an early and sudden visit some winter morning. h might learn that the baby's illness or a change in the timetable was by no means the sole cause of the commuter's tardiness. Could he obtain the whole truth, he would dis cover that there are certain cold, stern realities about country life In the winter that his subur ban friend had never hinted at. For example, go a ng made dark by a snowstorm the commuter generally oversleeps. When the alarm clock gos off. he opens his eyes for a moment, sees how dark it Is, and then makes himself believe the clock was set two hours to early. The snow Is coming down so quietly and the ground is so thickly carpeted that pass- Ing teams do not arouse him. It Is not until one of the children, falls out of bed or the cook drops a tray of dishes on the kitchen floor that he begins to realize that the night has passed. On such a morning the furnace fire always goes out It has kept up a heroic fight all night for its existence, but the battle was too protracted and reinforcements came too late. He tries ta wash bis face, but finds that the pipes are frozen. He looks for a clean towel, but all the towels that are not soiled were washed yester day and now hang like so many sheets of metal on the line In the back yard. Should there be no cook, the commuter crawls downstairs and builds the fire himself. He ts compelled to do this, whether he wants to or not. It is only an hour before train time, and he knows that his wife will certainly need another half hour to curl her hair before she would even be prepared to build a fire. The ashes this morning choke the range as If they had I -a accumulating for week.-, and the wood sputter and refuses to burn, Of course the wood ai left outdoors all night. After the fires are built, the commuter realize that he must clear path to the street anil clean the sidewalk. If he doesn't, he will cause trouble not only at home, but throughout Slum ber Corners. His wife will certainly catch a cold, which she will attribute to the soft snow she had to wade through and which he did not shovel away. And all the citizens who pass Ills gate will look at that uncleaned path, and sizo up the situation in one of two ways.

Mr. Spooner replied to Mr. Carmack. saying that be had felt regret at harlnc the criticisms of the President, who fca registered an oah In heaven to fllscharre his duties. Mr. Carmack had made a sinister and ported statement when he paid thtt .la country had begun a systematic encroach ment on the rijhts of the South American republics. No man had itood more consistently for those republics than had President Roosevelt, and Mr. Spooner instanced the course of the President In he Venezuelan difficulty. No President In our history had stood more stanchly for the Monroe Doctrine. He hoped the Southern republics would turn a deaf ear to any Individual prommclamento to the effect that the United States could over in terfere In their affairs except In their interest. Mr. Epooner also rave attention to the charges of obedience of law by the President. The ony nomlcs he has In the United States are. the. result c.f hi obedience to and enforcement of the law. he raid. He has thought, not of hlmsflf. but only of his oath. He has said again and again, speak ing of the relations of capital and labor, that they have an equal right to combine, but that both must keep within the lav. Mr. Spooner expressed regret that th canal question could not be separated from politics, and -.ni'd that the President's course was su-h us to subject him to the criticism of any political party. The President had been elected by the Republican part-, but, added Mr. epooner. he is the President of ail the country and he is entitled to fair and d scent treatment as the chief executive of all the people. AS the author of tha Spooner act. the speaker aid. he wished to express the opinion that the law had cot been violated by what the President had done.

VI r TiUman raid he would have entered Into nerotiatlons with Nicaragua, and would have re ported beck to Congress for further Instructions. He would then have eaid to Colombia You are a marry lot get off the face of tha earth well take -.he country and build the canal. The remark caused an outbreak of laughter, both m th floor of the Senate and In the galleries. After a minute's pause. Mr. Spoonr paid that while he could not accept the Senator's language he congratulated him on coming to the President 1 position. Mr. Tillman called attention to Mr. Bpooner's hesitation, and the latter replied that it was be ctUF he was thinking how thankful we should be that we sHUIi a President who would use to any nation such language as th Senator from South Carolina had used. Replying to the man and not to the Senator. Mr. TiUman asked Mr. Bpooner whether he would not prefer a President who would say in plain terms. Get out of the way. rather than to have mixed up In the bastard birth of the Republic of Panama. Continuing, Mr. Spooner warred tho Democrats thut a platform which Imputes dishonor to the administration and to the brave, true man in the White House will find no sympathy with the peo ple, ef the United States. North or South. Replying to a question from Mr. New-lands, Mr Spooner aid that Colombia had sought the Hny- Herran treaty, but he did not consider that the failure of that government to ratify the treaty was a breach of international law. Yet the Presi dent was right in contending that Colombia's fail re was a breach of the spirit of the treaty of UsC. because New-Granada had sought that treaty for hr own protection. He contended, in response to further Interruptions frcia Mr. Newlands, that the President had neither Intervened nor com mitted an act of war agalart the Republic of Colombia. Mr. TlUman aked if a discreet man would not tSto have waited on Congress before warning Co lombia off her own preserves at Panama, and Mr. pooner answered in the negative, saying that the Htfety. the honor and the Interests of the United States required that a. President should do Just what Theodore Roosevelt had done. Mr. Tman urged that Mr. Spoor.er had evaded the real Question. What he wanted to know was ixhether the President had the right to use the army and navy as he had '.one. Oh, Lord' exclaimed Mr. Spooner. You'll have to call on the Lord frequently in this matter. retorted Mr. TlUman. I did not address the Senator from Souh Caro lina my remark was not r.nonal, Bald Mr. fcpooner. Mr. Spooner declared that th President had acted within the Constitution and the law In all he had dene la Panama. It was both the right and the dty of the President to acknowledge the inde pendence of Panama. He said that he. for one. resented the imputation that the President had been unscrupulous In dealing with this question. Tins bMI Statement wae made after Mr. Tillman had expressed the, opinion that the American Con sol had bribed the Colombian forces to withdraw from the Isthmus. Mr. Spoeer said it was childish to say that the 1l lit bad transcended his duty. The first coi slderatlon of the Spooner act was that the right to bottd a canal should be secured, and that end had been accomplished by dealing, not with Co lombia, but with Panama, Colombia's successor. This was Just as legitimate, he said, as the trans action would have been if It had been between individuals. The attack, he went on. i so virulent and fMCVsabie that no reasonable explanation can be as of it except that cf partisanship of the bit terest kind. He Invited the opposition to test the question by an early vote and closed with a defence of the President as a brave, patriotic and frank man, woo tries to do what the law demands.

It can be stated with authority that the administration does not con template paying one dollar out of the United States Treasury to Colombia on account of the secession of Panama. Nor will It go before the Hague tribunal as a party to any proceedings growing out of that secession. It Is said that to do either of these things would be to commit the administration to an admission that It had been guilty of wronging Colombia. On the other hand, it is again announced that the United States stands ready to do everything In its power to bring about an amicable under standing between Colombia and Panama. It may be that Panama will consent to go before the Hapue tribunal with Colombia and allow that tribunal to decide whether 'or not Panama shall make any concessions to Colombia on ac count of the severance of political ties. It Is certain that tne United States government would look with favor on the assumption by Panama of some small liability, to make good the heavy loss which Colombia has suffered. Th- government is even willing to go to the extent of guaranteeing the performance by Panama of any duty ard obligation she may assume toward ColombiP, and exchanges on this basis between the interested parties are now In progress. HALES PACIFIC MOVE. Would Ask President to Tender Good Offices to Colombia. FnOM TITE TRIPrN-E BUREAU. Wr.shingrton, Jan. 13. The beneficial effect of Senator Hale's paciHc diplomacy as exercised in yesterday's debate was clearly observable to day, and out cf the confusion of thought which was prevalent In many quarters at the close of yesterday's session there has crystallized a be lief that the adoption of the resolution whirh Mr. Hale offered to-day as a substitute for that offered by Mr. Bacon may prove a judicious move. The first evidence of the beneficial effect of Mr. Hale's tactics Is the determination of Sen ator Lodge to withdraw his motion to lay the Bacon resolution on the table a course which, while it seemed imperative because of the dan ger of misleading the Colombians, would In evitably have elicited acrimonious- opposition from the Democrats. The Bacon and Hale resolutions will now go to the Committee on Foreign Relation, where they will doubtless be made the subject of consider able debate, and It Is by no mean 3 unlikely that the result will be the reporting of a resolution along the lines suggested by Mr. Hale. Such a resolution would undoubtedly afford a bridge whereby a number of Democratic Sen ators could cross the objections to which they are already committed, and several have pri vately expressed the hope that the Repul leans would give them such an opportunity. Another consideration which will be brought to the attention of the committee will be the possible assistance which such a resolution might afford to the Colombian leaders, who thoroughly appreciate the futility of resisting the course of events, but are experiencing diffi culty in restraining their followers. Secretary Hay has already tendered the good offices of the United States In the disagreement between the Republic of Panama and Colombia, and from Etrlctly logical point of view the Hale resolution is unnecessary, but as a pure matter of expedi ency, which might prove a soothing application to the Colombians, who are stricken with re morse at their own injudicious course, it might have a beneficial effect on the situation, and there are a number of Senators who will advo cate its adoption on that ground. The resolution is as follows Wheieas, The State of Panama, formerly a part of the Republic of Colombia, has seceded from that republic anc has set up a government, republican in form, under the name of the Republic of Pan ama ami, Whereas, The lndrpndene of said Republic of Panama has bten recopnlzfd by tho United States and by many other nations and. Whereas. A treaty is now pending before, the Sen ate between the United States and the Republic of Panama the ratification of which will Insure the spcJy building of the lnteroceanlc canal by the United States across the territory of said Republic of Panama therefore. Resolved, Thai in any claim which the Republic of Colombia, in any form, may make against the said Republic of Panama for Indemnification for loss of territory or increased burden of the bt of said Republic of Colombia, the President Is re quested to lender his best otiices toward tic peace ful adjustment of all controversies that have arisen, or may arie. between said Republic of Colombia aiid the Republic of Panama. Senator Lodge has had inserted in The Rec ord the statement made by Richard Olney, when Secretary of State, regarding the power of the President to recognize a new government. It was made in December. IS'JIJ. Just as a resolu tion was being prepared respecting the inde pendence of the so-called Republic of Cuba. Dm power to .ecognlze the so-called Republic of Cuba as an Independent State, eaid Secre tary Olttey, rests solely with the Executive. A resolution on the subject by th Senate or House, by both bodies or by one. whether con current or Joint, is inoperative as legislation, and is important only as advice of great weight ten dered to the Executive regarding the manner in which he shall exercise his constitutional func tions.

A resolution denouncing the appointment of ex- Congressman Loud as representative of this coun try by tha World's Tostal Congress at Rome was adopted at a meeting of the Postal Progress League. The meeting was held In the rooms of . rird of Trade and Transportation. Among those present were Colonel Albert Pope, Jamos L. Cowlee, John Briebon Walker and Gaylcrd Wilt shire. As the league is In favor of the adoption of a parcels post, it was declared that tho appointment of Mr. Ioud was an outrage because of his pro nounced attitude In favor of allowing private en terprises to carry r'ial matter. A committee, con sisting of Colonel I'opa, Patrick Family and Mr. Cow was named to draw up a schedule of the reasons why they considered the appointment Im proper, it was empowered to end the protest to all Chambers of Commerce ami Boards of Trnle for their Indorsement an'J then forward it to the Ir.i.l-n Mr. Walker, while explaining how useless it was to try to have Congress establish a parcels post system, declared that when John Wanamaker was Postmaster General he sal. that there were four insuperable obstacles to such a lav as was desired, and named four express companies as the ob- BICCIfS. A bill now before Congress providing for tha con solidation of third and fourth class mail matters and also to take such other measures as might be advisable to insure an improvement in postal ar ranrments and in the organization of a postal parcels system wan indorsed. A resolution was passed recommending to the Chambers of Com merce and Hoards of Trades of the cile3 of the country an r.iit-al to Congress that the United States receive -ntl facilities for parcels equal to those possessed by the leading companies of Europe, and further recommending the purchase by the government of any private Interests which may be affected by the adoption of uuch a postal system.

January 11. coincides with the information re ceived by the foreign legations here, and also strengthens the impression that war is unavoidable. At the Japanese Legation no effort Is made to con ceal the belief that war Is expected. The crux of the situation is M.UI Russia's refusal to admit the right of Japan to a voice in the settle ment of Manch'irian affairs, which Japan considers cne of its most vital interests. To sustain this contention the Japanese government is determined to resort to arms If necessary. The maintenance of Chinese neutrality would banish thn Idea of a Russian occupation of Peking, which is greatly alarming the Chinese, and is caus ing some uneasiness at the legations, since In an ticipation of Russia's approach the court would leave Peking. RUSSIA'S NAVAL MOVE. Entire Volunteer Fleet Claimed for Use in'the East. London, Jan. 14. Tha Times's Moscow cor respondent says he hears that the government has claimed the services of the entire volunteer fleet. RUSSIA NOT PREPARED. Railway Service Hampered Chinas Attitude Changed. London. Jan. 14. The Times's Peking corre spondent saye Russia's position in Peking is now a remarka ble one. and the change in China's attitude is striking. Russia's wanton violation of all her pledges has finally undeceived China and thrown her into the arms of Japan. While Japan's preparations are completa and her intelligence service singularly effective. Rus sia Is not ready. There 13 great confusion on the Manchurlnn railway owing to the difficulties at Lake Baikal, and few Russian troops have arrived In the Far East by land. Russia's military strength east of Lake Baikal Is exaggerated by the European newspapers. The Dally Mail's Toklo correspondent says that Japan's last note Is couched In most cour teous language, but that it reaffirms absolutely and unequivocally Japan's inability to accept Russia's proposals, either as regard Corea or Manchuria. MEDIATION POSTPONED. No Action To Be Taken Until Japans Reply Is Known. Paris, Jan. 13 No action has yet been taken In the direction of mediation between Russia and Japan, but It Is learned that the powers de sirous of peace tn the Far East ar considering the desirability of surh a step. Whether the proposed action will be Joint or Independent is not yet determined. It was stated to-day that no representation of a mediatory character would be made until after the contents of the Japanese reply to the latest Russian note had become known, but that there would then be an effort at mediation If the situation warranted it. There seems no doubt that such a step will be permissible with out giving offence to either disputant, under the t-rm.- of The Hague convention, to which Japan as well as Russia was a signatory- STEAMERS IMPRESSED.

British Opinion on China's Netc Treaties Gain to Japan. London, Jan. 14. A1l the morning papers have editorials which attach great Importance to the ratillcatlon of the commercial treaties between the United States and China and between Japan and China. The consensus of opinion In these editorials is that the ratification of the treaties implies an act of sovereignty by China equiv alent to a declaration that Russia's occupation of Manchuria is only temporary and for specific purposes. The pro- Japanese Morning Post says That is precisely the point for which Japan has been contending and which Russia declined to dis cuss with her. Japan is' now In the advan tageous position of championing a cause which Is also that of the United States. The Dally Telegraph saya that Japan Is naturally proud of being Sn a measure the cham pion of Western rights In the Far East. The Daily News' thinks that China -'has dis played ominous courage In her recent diplomacy, which will make for peace, owing to the tre mendous hazards which war under the present circumstances would Involve. The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Paris edition of The New-York Herald and dis patches from other correspondents at the Rus sian capital cay that the opinion is held that the ratification of the Japanese and American treaties came as a chock to the Russian Foreign Office.

Ratifications of the com mercial treaty between the United States and China were exchanged at the State Department to-day by Secretary Hay and Sir Chentung Liang-Cheng, the Chinese Minister here, and lata this afternoon President Roossveit issued the following proclamation, putting the treaty Into effect By the President of the United States of Amer ica. A Proclamation Whereas, A treaty and three annexes be tween Urn United States of America and China to extend further the commercial relations be tween them and otherwise to promote the in terests of the people of the two countries were concluded and signed at Shanghai, In the Eng lish and Chinese languages, on the Bth day of October, 1900, the original of the English text of which treaty and annexes la, word for word, as follows Here is published the text of the- treaty. And whereas, The said treaty and annexes had been duly ratified on both parts, and the ratifications cf the two governments were ex changed In the dry of Washington, on the 13th day of January, 1004 Now, therefore, be it known that I, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, have caused the said treaty and an nexes to be made public, to the end that the same and every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof. In testimony whereof. I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this 13th day of January, in the year of Our Lord, 1904, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-eighth. THEODOFwE ROOSEVELT. By the President JOHN HAY. Secretary of State. The following statement regarding the treaty wa3 Issued by the State Department The treaty which will go Into effect In a day or so. through the exchange of ratifications ef fected to-day, and by Its promulgation by the President of the United States, is tha result of nearly a year and a half's negotiation. Although relating in Its principal provisions to questions of commerce and navigation, removing restric tions which have hampered them both in China, it also treats of a number of questions of great importance to the people of the two countries. For example. It defines the rights and privileges of the diplomatic and consular officers and of American citizens, especially missionaries, resid ing China, and Insures the latter enjoyment of rights which they have only had In the past practically by toleration. The treaty also deals with trademarks, copyrights and patents. In suring them a fair degree of protection in Cblna a thing which they have had very little of In the past. Perhaps the provision of the treaty which In terests most the public is the opening of two new localities In Manchuria to foreign trade the city of Moukden and the town of An- Tung, or Shao, as it is frequently called, on the Yalu River. It Is to be noted In this connec tion that the Japanese and Chinese treaty, the ratifications of which were exchanged yester day at Peking, secures also to lnternationil trade the opening of the port of Tatung Kou. about thirteen miles below An-Tung, and at the mouth of the Yalu. It Is highly probable that the presence in these localities at an early date of American consular officers and those of other nationalities for all the nations having treaties with China acquire by our treaty, and that with Japan, the right to establish consulates at these placeswill greatly tend to the establishment of order In this much disturbed border land of China, and will powerfully contribute toward lnsurinp the principles of the open door. to which this country stands Irrevocably comm't well as aiding In insuring the lntesrrlty r- Chtaw and Its administrative control over its Manchurian provinces. The exchange of ratifications took place at the State Department by appointment at 11 o'clock. The Chinese Minister was accompanied by his secretary. Everything had been arranged, and Mr. Conger had informed the department that thf Chinese government placed an exchange copy of the treaty In h. hands yesterday. This is held to be equivalent to the delivery of the document to the United States government as required by the treaty itself. So Secretary Hay and the Chinese Minister joined to-day In the signature of the protocol, reciting the fact that ratifications had been exchanged. The Chinese Minister will receive a copy of the treaty by the State Department, which he will forward to his government for deposit In the imperial archives In Peking, and when Mr. Congers copy reaches Washington It will be placed in the State Department Library. The treaty is now an accomplished fact, and ft remains only to appoint the necessary con sqls at Moukden and An-Tung. The President has selected these consuls from men of expe rience already in the consular service, and con sequently able to open the new field to trade with the least possible delay. Their names will bo sent to the Senate as soon as Congress makes provision for their salary, which the State De partment hopes will be done speedily. It is re garded as extremely desirable that such rights ps the United States has acaulred in Manchuria. as to China shall be fully established and as serted in advance of any possible war that might affect that vast territory to the extent of a change of sovereignty. CHINA-JAPAN TREATY. Providing a Place of Residence for Foreigners in PeJcing. Washington, Jan. 13 The Japanese Minister hers.

Article VU requires the Chinese officials to re form the system of Chinese weights and measures, beginning the use of the new measures at tha treaty ports and gradually extending Inward. Article V pledjres tha Chinese government to amend and modernize the existing rules for Inland steam navigation. Article IX guarantees to Japanese officers and subject full and free participation in all privileges enjoyed by officers sad sub.'ci of sVJsSS nations.. and Japan undertakes to shsrs Hk privileges to Chinese tn Japan. This Is la substance a favored nation clause. Article X provides for the creation of an Interna tional settlement in Peking on withdrawal of the foreign legation guards and the foreign troops in Chl-Li. In this same articla China undertakes within six months to open to trade the port of Chang-Sha-Fu. In the province of Hunan also.

Russia Merely Promises to Respect All Treaty Rights. Berlin, Jan. 11. The BoS government has Informed the powers that it will respect fully the- lights any nation has ln Manchuria under treaty mitt China. Thie declaration ls made without reservation. Russia elves fermal expression to this policy now, in consequence of the controversy with Japan, one of whose persistent osjntentions has been for a definition of Russia's policy ln Man churia and an acknowledTnent of Japan's trade privileges. Russia's reply has been in btrar.ee as follows We cannot discuss Manchuria with you any more than we could Australia or the Philippines. Manchuria belongs neither to us, nor to you. It tfoee not lie within the Jurisdiction of either of us to dispose of the future of Manchuria. Ru66ia, however, is willing to observe tfce treaty rights of all the powers ln Manchuria, and now engages to do so, thus removing- from the negotiations one of the points upon which Japan counted for the moral support of other powers, and especially had the sympathy of the Vnlted Btates and Great Britain. The statement published ln London on high authority that Germany and the Triple A BMS will remain neutral In case of war between Rusre and Japan ls confirmed bere. London, Jan. 11.

RECEDE OR FIGHT. Only Course for Russia Balfovr Witt, Hold to Treaty. London, Jan. lii. The Tirr.es's Peking cor respondent, telegraphing under yesterday's date, says that the Chinese Minister at Tokio. at the request of the Japanese Foreign Office, tele graphed the following communication to Prince Ching The second Russian reply to the Japanese pro posals has been received at Toido, but it is un favorable and cannot be accepted by Japan, who will, unless Russia recedes, be compelled promptly to resort to a.s. In view of euoh an eventuality Japan urgee and expects China to maintain the strictest neutrality, to preserve order through the em pire, to guard the foreigners resident in the interior, and to take special care to preserve order in the provinces of Shan-Tung and Yun- Nan, lest foreign powers may seize the pretext of disorder and make aggressive movements therein. The correspondent says that the dispatch has deeply impressed the Chinese, who now believe war to be inevitable. Ue adds that notes looking to the ratification of the treaty between China and Japan were exchanged yesterday afternoon, Mr. Balfour. the Premier, speaking at Man chester last night, declined to discuss the dif ferences between Russia and Japan, on the ground that such discussion would do little ser vice to the cause of peace. The Premier said Xo one can contemplate hostilities between two great civilized countries without feelings of misgiving- and depression. The Premier added that Great Britain would carry out to the fullest extent all of her treaty obligations. W. St. John Brodrick, Secretary for India, speaking at Guildford, said he hoped war would be averted. The government, he said, would do its utmost to promote a peaceful solution of the difficulties, but that if its effort failed Great Britain would 6eek to localize the effect of the conflict. Mr. Balfour's guarded statement is commented on by this morning's newspapers as an intima tion of the intention of the government to ac cord full support to Japan if circumstances arise which would call into action the Anglo-Japanese treaty. The Daily News, which represents a largo section of the British public, heartily disliking that treaty, regards Mr. Balfour's language as a plain and unneceesary threat to Russia, and declares that the treaty was made without consulting- the British representatives in Japan, who since its adoption have repeatedly warned the government of the perils attaching to it. RUSSIAXS APATHETIC. Mass of People Opposed to War Submarine Boat Rights. Moscow, Jan. 11. Notwithstanding the rumors of movements on the part of the Russian and Japanese armies and nayies. war Is not consid ered likely here. The Vedomoeti. which reflects the opinion of Influential merchants and the ed ucated middle class, says It is more Important for Russia to foster in ternal developments and husband her resources for a weightier purpose than to seek the acqui sition of a Yellow Russia, involving enormous expenditures and profiting only adventurers. The paper ridicules the reports of the depre ciation of Japanese strength and says She has five millions of men nearer the scene than Russia's one million. Japan Is better armed and equipped and has powerful backers. Rus sia cannot profit by a victory, and the results of her defeat would 1 e appalling to the country. Another paper says it is announced that Rus sia has acquired the rights for th Holland sub marine torpedo boats, and adds that It consid ers this will render the building of costly bat tleships unnecessary.

According to a dispatch from Sarajevo, Bosnia, to the 'Neut lie Presse, four thousand Albanians haw closed the road between Prizren, eighty-eight miles from Monastir. and Scutari, the capital of the vilayet cf the same name, their intention be ing to oppose the new gendarmerie organized under the Austro-RuHsUin reform scheme. A dispatch from Cettinje says that the gov ernment of Montenegro has decided to take steps for the immediate expulsion of ail Albanians. According to an unconfirmed report from Us kub, the Servian Deputy Archimandrite, Wassil, was shot by Albanians at the Detchlni Monas tery. It was expected that the Deputy Archi mandrite would succeed the late Monsignor Flrmllian, Bishop of Uskub. Rome, Jan. 11. Boris Barafoff, the Mace donian revolutionary leader, whose arrival in Rome the press here erroneously announced on January 3, arrived in this city last night. One of the objects of his visit Is to induce General Ricciottl Garibaldi to lead an expedition, hav ing for Its object the liberation of Macedonia from Turkish rule, similar to the expedition which Garibaldi headed at the time of the Greco-Turkish War. Sarafoff had an interview to-day with the leaders of the supporters of the Macedonian cause here. He said he wished to inform the Italian government that Macedonia was not satisfied with the Auatro-Russian action, and that a new revolution would break out next spring if all the powers who signed the Treaty of Berlin do not intervene and cause the grant ing of autonomy to- Macedonia. Sarafoff declared that the insurgents were ready for any step, and prepared to go to any extremity. He said that one of the objects of his visit to Rome was to learn what support the Vatican authorities would give his followers In Macedonia, and that the Orthodox Christians of the Greek Church In Macedonia were even prepared to embrace the Roman Catholic faith, as, he dei'lared. the late Pope Leo most anx iously desired. Barafoff is being closely watched by the Ital ian police. CUB AX S RATIFY TREATY. Measure Xot Debated PlatLsiviend ment Included. Havana. Jan. 11. The Senate, after clearing legislative business and being in readiness to adjourn until the spring, rushed the ratification of the so-railed permanent treaty with the United States. There was no debate, and the vote was ti'.ken simply by a show of hands and without a rollcall. Better Rtcio, Nationalist, demanded to be re corded la if negative, wo othtrs requested to be recorded SirnULtlvely. Tho treaty Includes all the provisions of the Platt amendment verbatim. This was the prop osition of the Cuban government, made because of the desire eventually to eliminate the amend ment from the constitution and so remove the cause of the constant criticism of the makers of the constitution for accepting euch an amend ment from the United States. It Is regarded as immaterial whether the reiuircnients and re strictions of the Platt amendment be continued In the form of a constitution or of a treaty. The treaty was signed on M.iy L ISOB, but was not ratified with the other treaties between the United Siutus ami Cuba at the close of the last session o Congress. The Committee on For eign Relations held up the treaty until to-day, and then reported it by order of the Senate. There was no apparent opposition by the metn lers of the commit tee, but tho eommltti ap peared afraid of tho possible political cftect of its action. Th.- report recommended the ndop tlon of the treaty, stating th.-it it would not change the political status or the relations be tween Cuba and the United States In any man ner.

SAYS MAN CONFESSES ARSON. Assistant District Attorney Garvan Has Nickel Plater Arrested. John G. Greenway. a nickel plater, at No. 48 Cntre-3t.. whs arrested yesterday in the District Attorney's ofllco on susplclan of arson in connection with three fires in lite place of business within the last few weeks. Acting Flio Marshal Da Malignon. after a conference with Assistant District Attorney Garvan, made the arrest. According to the Klre Marshal, the first of these susuiciouc tires occurred on December 24, when no damage was uor.e. On December iti there was a.n oihcr tire, with JTiOO damage. A ihlrd rire was dis covered on January - by another tenant, and put out before it gained headway. Mr Garvan has obtained a confession, ho says, from' Louis Fuhrman, of Xo. 1,130 Lafayette-ave., Brooklyn, a boy who was employed by lireenway. In this confession, according to Mr. Garvan. Fuhr man says that on December bis employer told him business was poor, and that he wu about redv to trv up. but that if he could set fire to his shop and pet part of the JI.WO Insurance on ii it would help him out of his difficulties. He orv'-ed the boy. according to the latter, half of whatvr insurance money might be obtained. Kuhrman then, according to his confession, made a short circuit of some electric wires around a bundle of oiiy cotton waste and thus started the blsse. BUCHANAN COMFIRMED. MINISTER TO PAXAMA. The Nen Republic Formally Recog nized by the Senate. FKOM TM TRIBCNTC EtliAC. Washington, Jan. 11. The confirmation of William I. Buchanan aa Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Panama, which wai accomplished nnally to day with only sixteen Democratic votes in oppo sition, is, regarded as extremely gratifying, con stituting, as it does, a formal re -osmition by the Senate of the new republic This nomination was sent to the Senate on De cember 12 and confirmed five days later, but on the llth Senator Morgan moved to reconsider the action of the Senate, on the ground that the nomination had not received sufficient considera tion, and since that time the question has been rending. The molion of Senator Lodge, made to day in executive session, to lay on the table the motion of the Senator from Alabama, was promptly carried by a vote of 38 to IG. and re moved all doubt, if any had existed, regarding the attitude of the Senate toward the naw re public. Added significance Is given by the small num ber of Democratic Senators who rallied to Sen ator Gorman's call to do everything possible to prevent formal recojrnition of Panama. Al though nearly twice that number of Democratic Senators are in the city, only sixteen were pres ent this morning, when, it was understood, the question would come to a vote, thus showing how halfhearted Is the support which Mr. Gor man is receiving in his efforts to lead his Demo cratic colleagues against the canal policy of the administration. There is further significance in the similarity. In so far aa numbers go, between the total Dem ocratic vote and the poll of Senators on that side of the chamber on the question of ratifying the treaty made recently by Senators Dubois and Carmack. It will be remembered that the poll showed only seventeen Democratic Senators who were willing to pledge themselves against the ratification of the treaty, and, while the record of pairs may show a larger number of Democrats opposed to Mr. Buchanan con firmation, their opposition was of such a half hearted character us to lead them to stay away from the session, at which they knew they would be called on to place themselves on rec ri. Generally speaking, the situation among the Democrats is simple. They are trying to con vince themselves that the administration vio lated International law in its relations with Pan ama and would be delighted to defeat the con struction of the Panama Canal, but, apart from a few extreme radloals. they well appreciate tha. any determined opposition to the canal would be opposition to the will of tho people and would niore likely than not prove harmful to their personal welfare in thlr States. The vote to-day was on party lines, with the exception that Senator ifcCreary, of Kentucky, voted with the Republicans. Mr. Buchanan now has full power to act for this government n nil diplomatic exchanges between the United States and the new republic. Senator Morgan took the floor when the BeiH ni went into executive to-day anl pro tested against the confirmation of Mr. Buchanan sis minister OB th ground that the place to which the President had made the appointment v.as not in existence at the tim the nomination Was inf'le. anil could not l-e reatel without the co-operation of the Senate. Senator Bpooner an swered for the Republicans. He cited numerous authorities and precedents in support of the I'r'-Kldent's a'tlon. Senator Allison also spoke briefly in support of the administration, hll Senators Bacon and Culbersen favored the Dem ocratic contention. PLEA FOR SAX AXDRES. Annexation by Panama Asked Co lombia's Exactions. 'lon, Jan. 11. The schooner Herald, which arrived here yesterday evening from Bocas del Toro. brought a commissioner from the Island Of San AnJres. who will endeavor to obtain the annexation of San Andres to the Republic of Panama, owing to the dissatisfaction of thf Inhabitants of the island with the recent op pressive exactions on the part of the Colombian authorities. The commissioner Kays four hundred Cl' n blan troops are now In garrison on the Islands of San Andres and Providence, and thit nor soldiers are expt-rted. The dissatisfaction, he adds, is general In the ilrvnds. In the last few weeks no less than 18.00 has beon collected by means of the property tax, which the in - habitants are not In a position to meet, but which they havo been compel to pay. Sev eral families have already gone to Bocas del Toro. The ports of Providence and San Andres are now closed, and coustlng vessels are not al lowed to depart. This does not apply to Amer ican vessels trading with Sitn Andrea. The commissioner, who is a seafaring man. SSeaOd from San Andres at night in a small schooner bound for Bocas lel Toro. Many of those who desire the annexation of San Andrea to Pan ama declined to sign tho petition, fearing the possible conseqnenceSL S.ui Andres does considerable business with thtj I'nite.l States in canuta. about twenty millions belnjr shipped there annually. Panama Is desirous of annexing San Andres and Providence, but it is believed that steps In that direction at the present moment would be inopportune. The United States marines encamped at Em pire and Ba Oblspo are kpt busy cleaning up the ground Biirroundlns the camps, which are located on a healthy hill, close to the railroad. The marines have also cleaned the Canal Com pany's houses, all of which now present a clean and smart appearance. Owins to the iti3ull- ient number of houses, about two hundred of the marines are in tents, the dry season hav ing set in. The marine oilicers are anxious to study the trails letullng toward the camps from Porto Hello One party of thirteen men came in to Baa Obispo recently, after coverta seventy n-iles across n mountainous country in six daya, Another expedition will set out from Porto Bpllo IT h day or two. under the command of Caotain luis M. Little. Th Mayflower ha- Just arrived here, after scouting along the coast as far as the Gulf of Darlen. The warship stopped at several points along the San Blait coast, and found the attitude of the Indians everywhere to be unfriendly. They declined to give information of any scrt, and refused to sell the ship fruit or fish, or any thing required. . Th otneers of the Mayflower were repeatedly askfd to leave tho coast, and were made to un derstand that the presence of either Panamans or Americans in their territory was unwelcome to the nntives. A man on board the Mayflower, who peas Spanish, says that in a conversation with an Indian he learned that the Colombians are in league with the San Bias Indians, whom they bribed. The Atlanta, which is still in the vicinity of Porto Bello. has sent out several scoutinc par ties along- that coast, to learn the mountain trails leading to Colon. ASK SENATE TO GO SLOW.

REYES DEPARTS. Relations uith Colombia Xot Severed A Threat Ignored. Vashinston. Jan. 11. General Rafal Reyes, Colombian Envoy, who has been in Washington in connection with the Panama question for about a month, left the city at midnight for New- York, preparatory to his departure for Co lombia in a few days. Preceding him went Gen eral Ospina, who came here with General Reyes as his legal a.lviser. and who started for New- York on an earlier train. General Oapina, how ever, does not expect to return immediately to Colombia, as he has business Interests In the United States demanding- his attention. The departure of General Reyes doea not break off diplomatic relations with the United States, but merely suspends the negotiations which havo been goinj on with the State De partment, having ln view the reintegration of Panama as a part of the United States of Co lombia. Whether they will be resumed here after is not known. Dr. Kerran, the Colombian Charge d'Affaires, remains ln WashliiKton to attend to legation business other than Panama matters. It ls not likely that he will lave the city for two months at least, If then. His fut'.'re movements are un determined. Advices received here from Colom bia Bhcr.v that there la still considerable excite ment there over the attitude the United States has taken. General Reyes had a conference with Secre tary Hay to-day regarding the Panama situa tion, lie announced at the close of the inter view that he would leave Washington for Nevr- York at 123O o'clock to-night, not expecting to return. He will 9all from New-York next Saturday, direct for Colombia, on the steamer Allegheny, which does not touch at isthmian Irt3. General Reyes nas paid his official fare v.fll to Secretary Hay and to the President through the Secretary. General Rtysi in his last note to the State Department, threatened to publish the corre spondence between himaelf and the department if the department uid not see fit to send it to the Senate or make it public The department ig the threat. Secretary Hay has not reached any decision about sending the correspondence to Congress, as requested by General Reyes. He has endeav ored to show General Keyes the futility of Colombia's efforts to regain Panama, but re garus the ma-r as still open to further efforts toward a peaceful adjustment. S rotary Hay called at the White House to day and had a long conference with the Presl dent. The Intel Vied with General Reyes un doubtedly formed the basis of the conference.

Japans Demand Baron Hay ash i Explains Situation. London, Jan. 12. A dispatch from Toklo to JUuter'a Telegram Company says that an newer from Russia will probably b asked at fixed date. IL Pavloff, the Russian Minister at Seoul. has Msured Baron Hayashi. the Japanese Minis ter here, that the number of Russian legation ,-uartis wiil not exceed 12t. The Japanese Min ister proposed an arrangement by which a col lision between the Russian and Japant-sa guards would be avoided, end this proposal was cord l.ly accepted by the Russian Minister. Baron Hajeshl said to-day that he had com municated to the British Foreign Office the ac tion of Japan in urgirg Chinese neutrality. The Minister added that the wcrds promptly resort to arms. used in The London Times's dis patch from Peking to-day, appear to be a mis take, which he attributes to mistranslation by the Chinese officials. What we have done, ald the minister, is to urg neutrality upon China ln the event of war, so as to minimize the disturbance of trade, avoid internal disorders ln China, guard for iners resklnt in -.he Interior and avoid un necessary complications of China's finances, and tor the purpose of limiting as far as possible the theatre of war, should war result. I have not yet received any intimation as to what action my povernment Intends to take, or what Is the result so far of the deliberations of the Elder Statesmen. Baron Hayashl's view of the Russian circular referring to treaty rights ln Manchuria is thnt tt is contradictory. So treaty rights, the rain lster says, can be of any real pood unless rtusia recognises China's sovereiirnty ln Man churia. By this last declaration Russia appears t. do this, but at the same time ehe persistently refuses Japan's demand for a formal recognition thereof. That is the point on which such a grave issue hangs. RUSSIAN VIEW OF REPLY. Immediate Rupture Not Expected Newspapers Bitter. E. Petersburg, Jan. Japan's reply Is ex pected In two or thre days, according- to reliable Information received here, and there is g-ood WMOB for believing that the response will be eo worded as to prevent an immediate rupture, 3ea.vli both g-overnrnenls In a position to con tinue negtytis-tions looking 1 to a pacific settle ment. The newspapers here continue bitterly to criti cise Great Britain's loan of officers and sailors to Japan for the purpose of navijratln the Jap anese warships Kasaga and Xlasln from Genoa to the Far East. The opening of Moukden, An-Tung or T- Tung-Kao to foreign trade, In accordance with the American ar.d Japanese commercial treaties with China, without thf consent of Russia, is denounced editorially by the Svlet as beinjj an open provocation of Russia. The same paper retmts the Fugpestion from a Ntfv-York newspaper that the differences be tween Russia and Japan be referred to the Haue tribunal.

PLAN TO BLOW UP LINE. Japanese in Disguise at Points on Siberian Railzvay. Liverpool. Jan. 12. An hifmni statement In connection with the strategic value of the Trans- Siberian Railway was made to-day by Fulford Bush, a member of a British mercantile firm at New-Chwung. Addressing tha Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Bush, after covering the question of the light construction of tha railway and the probability of th line being blocked if subjected to heavy military traffic, said that his own observations, coupled with trustworthy native Information, convinced him that at least two hundred Japanese military en gineers, disguised as Chinese coolies, barbers and other menials, had already been distributed at points along the railway, and that it would not be a fortnight after the declaration of war before the line would be blown up at a dozen places. The Chamber of Commerce adopted a resolu tion urclng th Foreign Office, In view of the great commercial Interests involved, to take active steps in connection with Japan and other powers to secure the fulfilment of tha treaty obligations of China. JAPAN'S RESOURCES. Army Said to Number GOO ,OO0 A War Likely To Be Long. St. Petersburg. Jan. 12. M. Kurino. the Jap anese Minister, in an interview said that if war should come he believed it would be a prolonged one. He said it was difficult now to see how it could he decisive, considered solely from a military point of view. The majority of the people of Kussia, said the minister, and many persons abroad have underestimated Japan's fctrength. The idea prevailing In some other wise well Informed quarters that Japan wouM be unable to put more than 200. soldiers in the field is entirely erroneous. Minister Kurino said he was still hopeful of peace, but was confident that if necessary a Japanese army of more than 600, men would give a good account of Itself and do credit to Japan's military system and that country's system of compulsory education. He said that Japan's coast defem-es were so strong that Gen eral Kuropatkin, the Russian Minister of War, had freely admitted that even a coalition of tha powers would be una'ola to effect a landing on Japanese soil. The opinion prevailing abroad that the ter mination of negotiations would necessarily mean war is not held strongly here. It Is pointed out that Russia has never declared what she intends to do. CHINESE TREATY READY. Will Be Made Effective in a Day or Tilo by President's Proclamation. Washington, Jan. 12. Sir Chentung Liang Ch'ng, the Chinese Minister here, called upon the acting Secretary of State, Mr. Loomis, late this afternoon and Informed him that ha had received a cable dispatch from Peking stating that the Emperor had flxed his seal to the Chinese-American treaty, and, further, that tha Emperor had uuevded to the request of tha American government, thnough Minister Conger, for the immediate exchange of ratification. Therefore, without awaiting the arrival ln Washington of the copjr of the treaty from Pe king, the minister and Secretary Hay will, within a day or two, sign a protocol equivalent to tha exchange of ratifications, ar.d. tha President's proclamation being Issued, the convention will go into effect immediately. The minister's advtcea Induced the State Department to change the plan it had formed earlier in the day to await tha arrival of the mall copy of the treaty. JAPAN'S TREATY IN FORCE. Ratifications Exchanged at Peking Mr. Conger Urges Haste. Peking, Jan. 12. United States and Japcui have strenuously endeavored to estab lish their rights in Manchuria under the new commercial treaties before war breaks out. The ratifications of the American treaty were to have been exchanged at Washington, but with the view of obviating the delay Involved ln mailing the Chinese copy to Washington, Min ister Conger lb urging the government to Bend a telegraphic copy, and to authorize th Chinese Minister at Washington to make the exchange therewith. Until the ratiacationa are exchanged it is lmpos3iUe for the United States to claim the right of sending consuls to Moukden and An-Tui.tr. The ratifications of the treaty between Japan and China were exchanged at the Foreign Ofllce here yesterday. A special agent brought the Japanese copy from Tokio. The Chinese officials aske.l for the delay of a day, to arrange some details, but the Japanese Minister refused to agree to any delay. Thla haste ia considered significant. According to the latest reports received here Russia propoaes to concede to Japan no higher status in Manchuria than is involved in the formal confirmation of her treaty rights, thus confirming similar reports from various sources published in Uurope and the United States.

The Virginia World's Fair comnibitlon, headed by W. W. Baker, of Rich mond, which came here to settle differences about exhibit spaces, returned home last night considerably disgruntled. Yesterday afternoon they threatened to no back to Richmond and have the Virginia Legislature repeal its ap propriation for an exhibit at the fair and divert the moiu-y to other uses, but they ware per suaded to more pacific declarations before thay departed, though far from being completely mollified. The trouble arose over their treatment at the chief's office In the department of agriculture. The Virginians said that they were handed over to a irilnur clerk, whu not nly treated them ex tremely cavullerly, but paid no attention to their requests. Whereupon the sons of tho Old Do minion marched out In blffta dudgeon. Fortu nately, friends both of them and the exposi tion heard of the row and went to the heads of the fair. These otllcial.s at once sent for the Virginians and offered them the best sprice. Things papse.i off with outward smoothness after that, but the angry fires still smouldered ln the Virginian breasts, and the end may yet be to come. MR. CHAMBERLAIN'S COMMISSION.

Continued from first puce. standard of judicial action, an opportunity for helpfulness has been lost. You will find that tne measure of rectitude in your past life will rLT t . the Private and civic virtues that you may achieve and maintain in the future, and inat in the end you will be judged by your whole IVxV, and not alone b ' thls intervening fault ana failure, in thia spirit, and in such expecta- Iv ave la your case ascertained and adapt ea the sentence to the exact accusation. By tne command of the statute I direct that you w imprisoned for one day in Raymond Street jaii. and I do further adjudge that you pay a fine of 10,. and In default of such pay mWmi u you be r ommitted to the same place unti tn flm shall be paid or you shall be omerwlse discharged according to law. Hugo Hirsh then addressed the court, paying a tril ute to his client's reputation, and saying The Interpretation of the statute as given by jour honor and the verdict of the jury permit no other construction than that Mr. Drtge-s aid commit an error. Xow, assuming that, there 19 only one thing for him to do as a frank, nonest, manly man. and that Is to take the punishment that your honor has sentenced him to. and comply with the decision of the court. We do not Intend to appeal. Ido not think that any one will ever believe that Mr. Driggs has been guilty of a conscious guilty action, but error is undoubtedly here. The check incident then occurred. District Attorney Youngs stepped up and, taking the sentenced man by the hand, said That's the right thing for you to do. It was the only thing to do, replied Mr. D rigg6, and his face flushed for tha first time. United States Marshal Haubert escorted Mr. Driggs downstairs to the marshal's offloe. There he remained, comfortably ensconced ln a leather padded chair, until 3liO o'clock. Mean while he had a good dinner that was sent in and enjoyed several choice cigars. The officials did not seem to want to explain why Mr. Driggs was not taken to Jail at once. At first it was said that the marshal was waiting for the commitment papers. When it was learned that they had been received the marshal said he had some things to do about his office before he could leave. It was 820 o'clock when Mr. Driggs left the Federal Uuilding under the escort of Deputy United States Marshal Caldwell. The men went out a side door, apparently unobserved. They went down Johnson-st. to Navy-st.. and through the latter to the Jail, which waa reached at 3i6 o'clock. Sheriff Hesterbers was waitlnc to receive his prisoner, and turned him over to Warden Mc- Laughlin. who took his pedigree. In answer to questions, Mr. Driggs gave his name, said he waa thirty-eight yearn old, was born ln the L'-iltd States, etc. Then he wau escorted Into Warden iirLaughlin's office. There he stayed for several hours, conversing with several friends who called to see him. The ex-Congressman did not partake of ths common prison food, but about 63J o'clock ate heartily of supper that had been brought in from outside. An anteroom, which is furnished with a bed. waa placed ut his disposal, and ln the evening he made himself as comfortable as pos sible in the circumstances, The officials of the je.il were under the strict est orders to say nothing whatever about Mr. Dries or what he was doing. Reporters were not allowed to see the prisoner, nor were they told where he whs. One of the keepers was ankd what cell Mr. Drlggs was ln, and he replied He is in parlor A. From Sheriff Hesterberg down not one of the officials would ay when Mr. Driggs would be released. The Sheriff said he did not know. Charles C Hyde, counsel for the Sheriff, de clared that tiire was considerable difference of opinion aa to what constituted a day. If he had advlsd the warden about the length of Mr. DrlggE's detention it was a confidential matter. As to when Mr. Prlggs wnull be released he really did not have the slightest Idea. Inquiry at the Jail proved unavailing. It was Intimated, however, that It would be some time this morn li. ivhn ho would be release.. There was a story that Mr. Driggs had de cM. d that he wanted to serve an entire twenty four hours, and would not accent a suggestion tr.it ha be released last night. Ar 11 .'i o'clock t was sail at the jail that LI. Drlgjrs had decided to retire for the night. RULES AGAINST MACHEN. Government Scores Two Points at Opening of Postal Fraud Trial. Washington. Jan. 12. Tne trial of August W. Macnen. the Groff brothers and Dr. and Mrs. George E. Loranz. for complicity In the postal frauds, began in earnest to-dny. At the outset the government cored two points, when Justice Prltchard refused to make a rule requiring the District Attorney to select the specific count of the lndloiment under which the defendants would be tried, and also when he permitted certain post ofllce Inspectors to remain In court after the other witnesses had b.en ruuired to retire. Six witnesses were examined to-day, all of them ln the employ of tho Postortice Department. Ex cept in Um case of Mr. Howley. chief clerk of the ottice t the First Assistant Postmaster Goi.eral. th testimony was duvold of any feature. Mr. Howley who had not completed his testimony when court adjourned for the day. was rigidly cross-examined by Mr. Kumler. of counsel for the lxrnaes. He admitted that frequently It hap pened that Machen'9 initials and siimature were placed on letters, orders and requisitions by his subordinates, and that this practice had resulted in an order to all division chiefs prohibiting their dek'Katlnr this authority to others. There was a noticeable increase, ln the attendance to-day. Conspicuous among thoe in the court room was the frmor First Assistant Postmaster Orneral. Perry S.

Philadelphia, Jan. 12. 1t is not at all improb able that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company will reject the bids submitted on December 10 by various contractors for the construction of the tunnels under the East and North rivers in connection with its New-York terminal, and ad vertise for new bids. Such action was fore shadowed a few days after the bids were opened, and now that sucient time has elapsed thor otiKhly to examine these bids, it has developed that, as a rule, they are not satisfactory to President Cassatt or to the engineering com mission which rvis-d the preparation of the plans and specifications und which will supervise tho work of construction. Whilo extreme reticence is maintained by the ofiicials of the company and the members of the engineering commissloq, it has been learned that some of the bids submitted were considerably higher than the estimate of the commission. Others were not in accordance with the specifi cations, ii some Instances being based upoii specifications or ideas ui' the bidders. 1 GD PRICES AT ART SALE.

Kx-Scnator Tonne to Drazc Tenta tive Platform for St. Louis. William J. Bryan, it was learned last night, has ass-nted to an arrangement thereby ex- Fenator Charles A. Town, of Minnesota, now a. resident of this city find a personal friend of Charles F. Murphy, Is to write a platform for eoaeAderation by the next National Democratic Convention. This plan v.-as agreed on at a conference at the Victoria Hotel a week ago, following the Saturday night reception riven for Mr. Bryan liy Mi friends after his return from Europe. At the conference were Mr. Bryan, City Court Judge Samuel Seabury, Melvln G. Paeer. Mr. Town, General Weaver, of lowa, and one or two others. A good deal of the talk was about the platform. The tone of Mr. Bryan's remarks in dicated that the Democracy should not be al lowed to take any backward stp, and that it would be better to put forward a platform that rhould mean relief from certain industrial conditions rather than to compromise with evil. Mr. Town, it is paid, ventured the suggestion tht he had several ideas on what the platform rhould contain, and Mr. Bryan smilingly eug gested that it would be a good idea for him to go hesid and formulate a platform which could be shown to the party leaders, and on which notes could be compared prior to the assembling of thft convention. It was suggested that it would tiot do to have it understood that anything that Mr. Town might submit in the way of a rough draft should be used to usurp the function of the committee on resolutions of the national con vention. It was said last night at the Hoffman House that nothing that Mr. Towne draws up in the form of a platform will be regarded as in any way official. It is believed that Mr. Metcalf, chairman of the committee on resolutions of the convention in 10K. will draft a platform, and for the conservatives Senator Gorman and ex- X senator David B. Hill are expected to contribute ft tentative main .planks. CLUB OVER THEIR HEADS. Radical Democrats' Plan to Name Man After Their Own Heart. DENVER MAN LEADS MOVEMENT. was learned yesterday that the radical Democrats of the Western and Southwestern States have organized a movement designed to club the next Democratic National Convention Into the adoption of a radical platform and the nomination of a candidate who will carry out th ideas of the platform if he is elected. Th head and front of the movement seems to J. A. Edgerton, of Denver, who will soon issue a call for a roundup of all the leaders of the Populists, Middle of the Road Populists, Silver Republicans and other radical elements in the Democratic ranks in the West at St. Louis on February 22, at which time a call will be inaued for a national convention of the radicals a dey or two after the adjournment of the regu lar at St. Louis In July. If the candidate and platform of the regulars do not suit the radicals they will go ahead and adopt a platform and nominal a ticket of their own. The radicals will then be In a position to take advantage of eny Bartons split In the regular convention. If any element in the convention bolts, the radi cals, vith their national convention immedi ately following the other, will be in shape to do business with them. There is a strong sentiment among the radi cals in favor of William R. Hearst, but at the v time they are not 1 ed up to him. The movement is an outcome of a plan outlined last July at a conference of the radical leaders in Denver, the home of Mr. Edperton. At that conference were Noah Tibbals. a Nebraska newspaper man, a personal friend of William J. Bryan, and J. A. Parker, of Louisville, of the Middle of the Road Populists. These men have i'en in this city of late, and have things in shape for co-operating with the bolters la cap of a split at St. Louis. The radicals allege that ihfy will poll a million votes this year if they run an Independent tickc-t. and that the regular Democratic candidate will lose all these if he. fioteat uit them and is not running on a plat form that conform to their ideas. One of their sin ins 1 1 1 is for an uncompromising warfare against the trusts. CROKER MAY STAY AWAY. Ml Mr. Cram He May Decide Xever to Return Here. J. Sergeant Cram, Richard Croker's personal friend and ex-Dock Commissioner, says that in his opinion Mr. broker In not likely to return to this country at all.

Mr. Crokfr told Mr. Cram that it would be sev eral years before he returned to New-York, and he might decide not to return at all. Mr. Cram say that Mr. Croker seems to be absolutely In different to what is Koinj on in politics in this Pity. M i ereatly interested in tlie national fight, hill II added Mr. Cram.

'' ii.i.fil from firot page. matte corps, v.-ho has been In elos,e communica tion with the French government relative to the Russo-Japanese situation, said to-day that a Ftrong feeling existed In the highest offtvlal quar ters that Japan had gradually enlarged her de mands until those of to-day went considerably beyond those first presented. Moreover, It is the belief of the officials here that Japan's steady Increase in her demands is due largely to her belief that Russia is desirous of avoiding war, and that therefore it is safe to push demands to the furthest limits. Thus far only a brief synopsis of the various i-mmds of Japan has been given to the public, end it li said that th oxact text of the reply Is necessary in order to show the gradual expan sion of the Japanese contentions. In particular it 1.1 the official view that Japan's present de mands for the integrity of China and full recog nition of Chinese authority uver Manchuria rep resent an important advance over the early rep resentations. It is pointed out that at the out set Japan and practically all the powers recog nized Russia's special Interests in Manchuria, but the view now prevails that Japan's de mands seek to minimize and restrict these spe cial interests within impossible limits. The diplomat summed up state and official sentiment here by saying that Japan's claims are onsidered to have reached an extreme which is licit likely to receive favorable consideration from Russia, and that at the same time this does not give Japan moral justification to resort to war. 7. i HDAXELLES KEPT SAFE. British Officials Sure That fftJttfa Will Xot Break Treaty. KING EDWARD APPEALS TO CZAR. London, Jan. 16. 1n the opinion of the British government the end of this week does not mark any change In the Far Eastern crisis, which more than ever keeps diplomatic circles in Lon don in a state of anxiety. The latest and, if it had been true, the most serious statement namely, that Russia intended to risk sending her Black Sea fleet through the Dardanelles received to-day a positive denial from the Foreign Office. Baron Hayashl. the Japanese Minister, visited Downing Street this afternoon, nnd was told that after making minute Inquiries the British authorities were convinced that the report was unfounded. Regarding the main issue. Baron Hayashi and the Foreign Office had no information. Not even the Czar's pacific utterances, however, can dis pel the fear which pervades British officials that Russia will not yield. King Edward continues to use his personal Influence to an almost un precedented extent to persuade the Czar to maintain peace, but the King's ministers appear to have practically given up hope that n. resort to arms can be averted, though even the most pessimistic persons do not look for nny culmina tion of the crisis within three weeks. The suggested Intervention, in the shape of tendering their good offices, on the part of other powers is now universally declared here to be quite impossible. How determined Japan is to face all the even tualities can be judged from the fact that she is negotiating in England for the construct of four battleships, not two battleship, as pre viously reported. The negotiations are not yet dosed, but the contract is likely to be taken up by the largest English firm within a week. The firm In question Kays that it is satisfied Japan is able to carry on a possible war long enough to pay for and use the vessels, which necessarily could not be ready under two years. The Spectator now regards vt as inevi table, in which ft merely follows up Its own significant -sruiBnt that 'a Russo- Japanese war would, be. to Great Britain's ad vantage, so long an Great Britain is only art onlooker and while th straggle does not in volve any other power. The Spectator has previously pointed out -in guarded language tnat surh a war was likely to leave both Russia and Japan crippled, neither gaining a great advan tage over the other, which suggest the deduc tion current In official circles here, that in this event Great Britain would he in a better posi tion to foster her sphere of influence In the Far East, unmenaced by the fear of Japan be coming a too paramount power in that quarter of the globe. Baron Hayashi said humorously to-night Great Britain and America might -li raise a. subscription In our behalf, for if war results and we win. they are bound to benefit by it. LAMGER GUARD AT SEOUL. Sixty More United States Marines in 'ity Sufficient Protection. S-oul, Jan. 10. Th American guard at the I'riited States Embassy has bMO increased. Sixty additional marines arrived here last night and are quartered In the city at the electric power company's building. The native press is Bligluly hostile to foreign residents, and it Is quite possible there Win yet be trouble with Corea. Troops now guard all the foreign residences, probably in sufficient numbers to keep the natives in heck should they begin to make trouble. Foieiiiers cannot be considered in danger. A German man-of-war has just ar rived at Chemulpo. A change in the personnel of the government has begun in favor of the Japanese, arid tht peo ple have been more angry with the government than the foreigners. It Is likely that this change will completely pacify them. The American authorities have taken the pre caution to provide male escorts for women and children of that nationality while on the street.

Washington, Jan. IC Such reports as the State Department has received through its va rious agencies in Europe and the East are summed up in the expression that the resources of diplomacy hive not yet been exhausted in the Far Eastern situation. It ia expected that Rus sia will delay several day at least before mak ing anfver to the last Japanese note, and It Is said at the State Department that this note con tains no time limit, but Pimply hints that an early answer will be acceptable. The note is far from being an ultimatum, and the officials do not expect anything in the nature of a crisis in the near future. Mr. Takahira, the Japanese Minister, had a long conference with Secretary Hay to-day, but he had no news of anything that had happened In the East since the delivery of the last Jap anese note. WATCHING EASTERN SITUATION. Secretary Hay and Chairman Hitt Confer with the President. Washington, Jan. 10. Secretary Hay had a conference with the President to-day. He was followed soon afterward by Representative Hitt, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House. The Interview between the Presi dent and Mr. Hitt was a prolonged one. Little Information could be obtained either from Sec retary Hay or Representative Hitt. The State Department is keeping in close touch with the situation in the Far East, and it is understood that the conferences to-day related to this sub ject. While the situation is regarded as serious, no developments of importance are expected until Russia has presented her reply to Japan's latest note. In the last two weeks 5,, in gold haa arrived at San Francisco from Japan to pay for food supplies and munitions of war ob tained In this country. More gold is now on the way to the United States from Japan to pay for other supplies. MORE VESSELS AT PORT ARTHUR. Two of Volunteer Fleet Arrive Denial of Dardanelles Report. Port Arthur. Jan. 18.

Colombian Representative Thinks His Usefulness Here Ended. Washington, Jan. 16. Dr. Thomas Herran, charge d'affaires of the Colombian Legation, has definitely decided to avail himself of the leave of absence granted him, and will tako his departure from the United States some time next month. Already the legation archives have been packed and stored. When Dr. Herran leave 3 Wahington the legation In this city will be closed, and its affairs turned over to the Colombian Consul General in New-York. In speaking of his determination to return to Colombia, Dr. Herran said to-night that so far as he could see his usefulness at this apital was at an end. - questions which have arisen in consequence of the secession of Pau. I . nna were, y virtue of the appointment of Grernl Keyes as special envoy, taken out of the hands of Dr. Herran. leaving him little or nothing to do. Besides, Dr. Herran says that the need of a rest and a trip to Colombia to attend to some personal affairs add to the factors which influ ence him to take his leave of absence at an early day. Up to January 14 the government at Bogota had not learned of General Reyes's departure from Washington, a cable dispatch under that date to Dr. Herran having reached .here to night, making inquiries as to General Reyes's movements, and also concerning the latest de velopments. XOT HIS, SAYS DR. II ERR AX Inquiry as to Authorship of an Arti cle Printed Over His Xame. Between Dr. Thomas Herran, Colombian Charge d'Affaires at Washington, and The Independent. of this city, there ig an issue as to the authorship of an article entitled The Isthmian Question. which appeared In the current number of that Journal over Dr. Herran's name. He now declares it an impudent fabrication. The editors of The Independent say that they printed the article in good faith, having received it a they had received several others from Dr. Herran. They have begun an investigation. The article which Dr. Herran says he did not write declared that Colombia had never relinquished bet claim to tho territory of the isthmus, now the Republic of Panama also that no troops had been sent from Colombia into Panama, because General Reyes had forblJden any movement of that sort before he left South America. If the negotiations between General Reyes and the I'nited States main tained the friendly relation between the two na tion', the writer said, the canal would be an im portant factor In the future peace of that part of the world. Yesterday the appended letter was received, by The Tribune. To the Kdltor of The Tribune. Sir The inclosed clipping from your Issii of yes tenlav baa called my attention to an article pub '... In The Independent. entitled The Isth mian Question, and purporting to be. a contribu tion from me.

No word has come on the subject from Mr. Merran. and this letter la the first intimation had of any complaint from him. Probably the article was prepared from an interview with Mr. Herran. and it would seem now that thr was me misunderstanding as to the way his naiaa was to be use.i in connection with It. The agent Han hitherto been found trust worthy, j,ikl it would bo extremely unlikely that he would have ntta-h.-.i Mr. Hetran's name to it unless he believed he had that gentleman' d permission. Hitmll in Holt, managing editor of The Inde pendent. gave exactly the rani' explanation. He had. he said, sent to tha Washington agent for an explanation as soon as he learned of the letter from Ir. Herran. Just why the Colombian Char T Affaire li.id no communicated with Th Inde pendent. howvrer, seemed to him much of a my u-ry. Copies of each Issue of that paper are sent to each contributor Mr. Holt failed to see how Ir Herran bad failed to notice the article.

Declares lie Bought Xatundiiation Papers from Accused Clerk. Tha preliminary examination of John W. K. York, the United States District Court clerk charged with naturalization frauds, was begun in the, Federal KuiUUng yesterday before United States Commissioner Shields. Roberto Bunoro and four other Italians were convicted hist fall of issuing and selling counterfeit naturalization papers, sentenced to a year and six months Imprisonment and pardoned so thai they might testify against York, who was impli cated in their confessions. Butioro testified that he first met York in 1900. when he paid him 5 for a duplicate citizenship certificate, and later obtained another for the same price, the name being left blank. He had obtained certificates from York when Samuel H. Lyraan was clerk of the United States District Court, and had frequently seen York sign 1-y man's name to the certhlcates. Witness said he had an understanding with York that the latter was to issue certificates of citizenship whenever Kunoro wished them, and to place them on record as a properly executed paper, for which York was to receive 5. York would give witness an order on the clerk for the certificate. 1 would pretend to be looking for a rubber and drop the money In the drawer of the table. said the witness, and other times I would hand it M York across the hall, but always so no one could see me do It. A dozen certificates of naturalization, all beating Italians' name., were Identified by Hunoro as ones he had purchased from York, paying 0 for each. All wrf turned over to him by York, prop erly executed, bearing the signature of the clerk of the United Stat-s District Court and seal of the court, name betas, left blank. Ha purchased about seventy-five or it hundred certificates from York. York used to take blank certificates to the home of the witness. Th witness denied thut he. knew .lames E March in 1899, or that March had any political papers. He alao denied that March ever employed him to gel citizen's papers or that he ever toll York or Deputy Clerk Gilchrist that he was help- Ins March. Adjournment was taken until next Tuesday.

Auditor Castle, for the Pontofflce Department, to-day sent to the Post master General and the Secretary of the Treasury the trial balance of financial transactions of the postal service for the quarter ended Soptembtr 3, 1903, showing an Increase In the deficiency of 22 per cent for the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

The members of the Sheldon syndicate of the United States Shipbuilding Company it was learned yesterday have received from the syn dicate managers a call for another assessment of IS per cent, payable on January 20, on which day the syndicate will expire by limitation. The syndicate, which was formed about fifteen months ago. bound Itself to furnish 54.123.0 X with which to enable the Trust Company of the Republic to pay off certain large loans made in connection with the financing of the shipbuild ing company, and took over from the trust company in exchange r,.-00,0 of the first mortgage rom3 of the shipbuilding company, 133001, common stock at.d -li, T.4 mm m pre ferred stock. Three calls of 2o per cent each had been made on th underwriters up to De o'rr.bor 7 last, when another 13 per cent was called up. The call now Issued is the fifth, and brings the total assessment up to CM per cent, or about ...7lO,iaio. It Is understood that no fur ther Call will be made, the syndicate managers having disposed of er.ough of the securities to make Op the dlfferer.ee between the amount al ready called up and the entire sum for which the subscribers bound themselves.

The last few days have witnessed an appreciable change in the views of some prominent Republicans, who have beer alleged, perhaps erroneously, to regard the can didacy of Theodora Roosevelt with lukewarm ness. The promptness with which certain capi talists have espoused the suggestion, never morer than tentatively put forth, that a Democrat President and a Democratic House would b capable of little harm, so lons as the Senate remained Republican, and the avidity of the. Democrats for power and patronage have con tributed materially to the second thought, the results of which are becoming apparent. Certain it is. at any rate, that some Republi cans who, only a short time ago. merely smiled when it was suggested that the success In the convention of any candidate other than Mr. Roosevelt might Jeopardize the success of the party, to-day meet that suggestion with en emphatic protest that a Republican victory must bo th first consideration, admitting with. the same breath that the strongest candidate r.i th- party will be the President. There are. it la asserted, so many policies to which the Republican party 13 committed, poli cies which require a strong, positive and even aggressive administration, and which would suffer incalculaMy from even one term of tha negative conditions which would Inevitably at tend a Democratic victory, that the very sug gestion brings a shudder to loyal Republicans in both houses cf I'.TfT- The Panama Canal, which Is now made pos sible only by the prompt action of the President t . critical moment, would, say thoughtful Re nl Hrajss, be even worse than abandoned if left to Democratic incapacity and indecision.

GOLD BRICK SWINDLERS. Cuntiniwd from fourth pugr. gold brick la shown around without reserve. It is submitted to the most careful tests by any one who la inttrestei enough in It to take the trouble. There can be no manner of doubt re garding its being the real thing, for it actually ia. When the victim is lured to his fate and the money has changed hands, the real brick accompanies the swindler to parts unknown, while the one the countryman taites to the mint, with exaggerated precautions for Its safety, proves to be only brass. This Is the course pursued in the case of easy marks. When the quarry proves more wary a more extensive campaign is conducted. Hav ing brought the game to the point described above, it ia possible that the intending- purchaser of the gold brh k insists upon a further test by some one more expert than the local wiseacres. Perhaps the .swindler Onda It better to suggest this very thing in order to lure the victim on. He the C'lil brfa k man porslst3 in warning the farmer and decrying any confluence In himself, a perfect Stranger. He suggests what looks like the essence of fairness, namely, that the brirk shall Le taken to a neighboring town and there submitted to the United Slates assayer for a final examination. The swindler wffl not take no for an answer. Go they must So they go. The United States assayer is found to be a gray bearded man of studious aspect. His office has his name on the door, with United States Assay Office in imposing gilt letters. The as sayer Is surrounded by rucibles, scales, tools and mystery. He is very busy and rather brusque. He says he is tired of testing gold bricks for mere thanks. He demands a heavy fee and gets it. Then he takes the gold brick, submits it to various tests, pronounces it the purest gold and turns to his work. To conclude the story quickly, the victim finds no United States assayer tberc when he comes back from his trip to the mint. The assoyer is helping his Mead, the gold brick swindl.r, in some other part of the country. The trick is varied to suit the various cases. Sometimes the brick tested is the real gold brick and the test is made before UM sharp eyes of the victim. Then the as sayer changes the brick for the bogus one by some quick sleight of hand. Th- result is al ways the same. Tht- museum at the mint is the final r. -sting place of the goto lri- k. Another rural individual gn.-s away wailing. Still the ancient swindle brings grist to the mill of the swindlers. WAR FORCES IN FAB EAST Continucil from econl pur. yards capable both of constructing and repair- Ing vessels or any cms In the mercantile j marine, which baa increased enormously within the last few years. Jap in has an ample supply of troopships and auxiliary rrui .- ra. The personnel -f the Japanese navy in 1902 consisted of 2 admirals, 1 vice-admirals, 2, rear admirals. C 5 captains, 110 commanders. 167 lieutenant commanders, 22' lieutenants. 305 sub-lieutenants, besides engineers, medical offi- i cers, etc.. and SMSBB sailors. The standard of discipline maintained on board hi that of the British navy. Their offlcen have either been trained on board British ships or have been in structed by British otllcers. A naval college is also maintained by the government. The ships have been exercised constantly, and their offi- j cers were tested in the Chinese war and found to i have courage, capacity and resourcefulness. The Russian navy consists of 18 battleships. 5 armored cruisers, 11 cruisers, protected and otherwise 7 torpedo gunboats. ' destroyers. 53 torpedo boats, built or building, and 2 sub- ' marine toredo boats. Of these different classes, nineteen are stationed In the Black Sea, and could not be of service in the Far Kast. A few others also are In the Baltic and Mediterranean. The chief vessels of the Russian navy are either In Eastern waters or on the way there. The fleet with which Japan will have to cope is made up of eight battleships, five armored cruisers and eight protected crolsera, besides a number of destroy CIS and torpedo boats, some of which are now on the way to the East, the total dis placement of which, excluding the destroyers, and torpedo boats, is 131.173 tons. of the bat tleships, the largest are equal In displacement to I the smaller battleships of Japan. Their gun pro- tect is less and none cl then throw so much metal at a broadside tire. They also have the disadvantage of Dot being of equal speed, three being able to malu 19 knots, two 18 and three 17. Thai reduces their effectiveness as a squad- ron, as they cannot mari'iMivre at a greater , speed than the Slowest In this respect they are Inferior to the Japanese vessels. The disparity in the weight of metal which the Russian ar mored cruisers can throw at a broadside Is greater in the class of armored cruisers. Not one of the Russian cruisers of this class can throw within two thousand pounds as much as any of the Japanese. In the matter of speed there is a lack of homogeneity, as In the case of the battleships. The Mayan has a speed of 22 knots, the Gromboi and Itossia of 20, the Rurik IS and the Dmitr Don-skoi 15. Three of these cruisers, however, are larger than any of the Japanese cruisers of the sane class. In pro tected cruisers Japan has the advantage aLso In the weight of metal which can be thrown and In numbers, but not in regard to speed, as one of the Russian cruisers of this class is reckoned as having a speed of 25 knots, three at 23 knots, one at 22 and three at 20. None of the armored cruisers are considered as good as those pos- sesred by Japan. The principal contrast which the Russian squadron presents to the Japanese la In lack of homogeneity, in weight of metal which can be thrown and thickness of protective i armor. Russia also has the disadvantage of having no place in the Kast where she can make repairs to her fleet The docks at Port Arthur are not completed and those at Vladivostok are now shut in by Ice. There are In the entire navy 10 admirals. 28 vice-admirals, 37 rear ad mirals, 102 captains. 202 commanders 1.542 Junior officers, 503 engineers. 702 medical and civil officers, 102 naval yard officers and sailors to bring the total up to 00, men. The men While of excellent stuff, are said to lack the trailing and experience of the Japanese Strategists think that rather than risk a naval engagement Russia will withdraw r- fr fWf ' under the guns of Port Arthur, thus making heTn T Japan to ni Ye her tro - the Yellow Sea. Japan then would be obliged to move them across Corea in order to strike a blow upon the land. This would make neces Stioi. maintenance a long land communi cation. In Japan military service la compulsory. Th. army, so far v military instruction hi con- 1 eerned, has adopted Germany as a moSet It a divided Into three groups the permanent estab lishment, the reserve and the terrltortaL The permanent establishment consists of 7,500 offi cers and 110, men. the reserve of 35. ad ditional men, and the territorial would bring another 200. men and 312 guna into line. The land strength in round numbers consists of 4C0, officers and men, 1.200 guna and 90,0tf horses. No one knows how many men Russia ha 3hi the East, but it Is estimated to be at least 130, . with upward of 300 guna. Not above 200,- CMJ ii.en. it ia believed, could be maintained there, because of the difficulty of forwarding supplies over a single track railroad, with sid ings twenty-five milea apart. Indeed, the Jap anese might add to this difficulty by attacking the railroad at vulnerable points. The peace footing of the Russian Army ia over - men. with 3.400 guns, and the war gMttag U men, with C.GOO guns. The Japar.esa while at Peking earned the reputation or well disciplined and equipped and a most for midable enemy.

About the only thint that hi be said in fa vcr of a general service pension, such as is pro ond In tli- bill introduced by Senator Dollivcr, i that It I not mi bad now aw It would have been ten years ago. Th.- present pension law is so liberal that any honest veteran who has any need for a pension can have one. and many a dishonest veteran is able to take advantage of Its provisions to get a pension when he is not in need and in no ie incapacitated. A service pension of 12 a month to the few who are not now enjoying the government's bounty would perhaps not overwhelm the Treasury. An the turn of the tide In pension expenditure under th present law appears to have been reached, and a slight decrease noted, it seems to ha in order to provide new outlet for government money, for it would never do in the world to let the business of the pension attorneys go on decreasing through the failure of '.'ingress to provide an unending strenni of client. But whether the cyst be small or great, the principle of a service pension is vicious. I patriotism to lie appraised on a cash basis Is every man who shouldered a musket at his covntTT's call, irrespective of his needs or his wounds, going to become a hanger-on of the Treasury The pension attorneys want this, and a ienttment has len artfully worked up in Its favor among veterans who probably have not carefully thought out all that it Implies. But we do not believe that th rreat body of brT and patriotic men, who are proud of their part In saving the Union, wish to lower the standard of devotion for future generations and teach the world that men who do not need pewrtisi thick that they inun be pubsidized for having been patriotic W do not believe they cars thus to cheapen their service. To the veteran who for any reason needs aid, and to Lose dependent upon him. a grateful country will erar bs delighted to minister. The coun try hi net yet prepared, however, for the doc trine that any citizen who merely does his duty thereby acquires a title to the alms of the tax payers, his fellow citizens. Thousands of ninety day soldiers wouid. under this bill. be entitled ro pensions -who never were in a battle and vno, so far as th war Is concerned, are Just kb well , physically and financially, as their fellows who did their duty In civil life. They j'.re mostly worthy men. who point with pride to their names on tbe army lists. But to make ai rh service an excuse for unneeded pensions hi to cheapen It, and also cheapen the pension list and detract from the distinction of those who hold an honorable plare on It by reason of t ' i-clal sofferlog Another phase of the matter to be considered 1 the precedent which such a measure would HMahMah for the veterans of other wars. We 1 ready see the tendency to demand for the participants In the little Spanish affair all the rtTilf which have been accorded l those who fought through the Civil War. How long would It be after the passage of the Do liver Ml before every militiaman who got as near th Cuban barrleflelds as Chlekamanga or Joined u '''' triatalial procession across Porto Rioo would be demanding a life pension in rec ognition of his sacrifices for hia country The Treasury can doubtless endure the proposed drain upon It. but can it endure the establish ment of the Idea that, instead of citizens owing freely their services to the government, the government owes a living, regardless of his ability to support himself, to every citizen who ever by any chance dons its uniform for ninety days COXYICTB OX THE ROADS. ioort roads are worth all and more than all that they cctrt under the operation of the law which provides for State and county co-opera tion in New-York. But if tnere is a way of lessening the expense without impairing the quality of the work or harming any interest it ought to be adopted. The consequence would be not a reduction of the amount of money ap plicable to the purpose, but an increase in the number of miles Improved. There is reason to believe that object might be attained by the em ployment of convict labor, with great advantage to public and prisoners. In Rome Western and Southern States this policy baa been Increas ingly pursued within the h-v few years, and official reports of Its success are not contra dicted by other testimony. During the last summer the experiment was made in Schenec tfldy County, to the satisfaction of the local authorities, -vre learn from an interesting ac ccunt of it in The Municipal Journal and En gineer. After an investigation of the subject by a committee of the Board of Supervisors, a con tract was made with the town of Glenve for the macadamizing of a particularly bad piece of road, and in the course of seven mouths, with an average force of twenty prisoners from the county Jail, two and a half miles were put into excellent condition. The specifications pre scribed by the State where State aid is fur nished ere strictly followed, but the county and town bore all the expense, which, how ever, wi not g.vater than their share would have been under the provisions of the Iligbie- Armstrong law. One guard to eight prisoners was found to be enough, the men, as a rule, were cheerful and industrious, end the citizens suffered no annoyance or apprehension. Occa sionally a convict was Indisposed to exert him self, but he 6Oin changed his mind after being put on short rations. The committee made it a polnr, when a prisoner became noted for faiih ful service and good behavior, to give him em ploy rneut at current wages when his sentence expired. The official report frankly concedes that some questions were not completely solved by this brief experiment on a email scale, but in general the results fully justined the expecta tions aroused by similar operations in other parts of the country. It has long been a grave and at times a really distressing question how to find employment for prisoners without putting them Into harmful competition with free labor. To keep them In idleness Is a cruelty to them and a heavy bur den on the community. Iload building Js work which needs to be intelligently supervised, but otherwise requires littie Etcill. It is not work In which craftsmen would dislike to 6oe convicts employed. It Is more likely to be congenial than obnoxious to the convicts themselves, since it givs them some of the advantages of lib erty, while at the same time it tends to eradi cate criminal propensities. The chance of es cspes Is small, both because of the watcn kept and because a man under sentence for a com paratively light offence Is not often Inclined to accept such a risk of having his term of im prisonment extended. Undoubtedly the plan Is subject to some objections, and it Is possible that they might prove more serious In this State than they have been found to be in the Yest and South, though we see no reason to accept that hypothesis. At all events, the question is deserving of attentive consideration, for It seems to contain at least a partial solution of an embarrassing problem and to hi' adapted to the promotion of great public improvement. f'RLSIDEXT ELIOT OX LIBERTY. In his address to college men at the reception of the Brooklyn Tnlversity Club, on Friday evening, President Eliot took up a question which has been before discussed by other lead ers of public opinion, and came to the same conclusion, that true American liberty is gravely menaced by associations of employers on the one hand and employes on the other. His ad mirable and impreHslve utterance should have great Influence In arousing educated men to the sinister meaning of the present day drift to grind individual liberty and crush out individ ual opportunity between the upper and nether millstones of Intolerant and exclusive organ izations. Educated men have been too much in clined to accept standard of business ethics as they found them, enter the service of liberty de stroying corporations that offered them advance ment, and make terms with liberty destroying labor union. when it would conduce to their business success. The Brooklyn men who heard President Eliot's calm, clear and convincing ex position of the present state of affairs must have bans aroused to a new appreciation of the gravity of the task which they have to preserve freedom, a task which, in spite of warnings, they and other happy-go-lucky Americans are prone to estimate lightly. It is somewhat startling to find President Eliot quietly announcing, not as a figure of speech, but v. an actual simple fact, that In Boston to-day there Is less liberty than there was in 177.. Our ancestors fought King George because he would not give them enough liberty in that year. They endured a long war, and then established a government with a consti tution to secure the blessings of liberty to them selves and their posterity. Less liberty for their posterity now In Boston than when they r-roltd against a petty tax on tea, which inter fered with nobody's comfort or ability to earn a living' where and as he chose Yet, If we con sider, we shall pee that the statement is liter ally true. King George never dreamed of such interference with the colonists at the free citi zens of the United States and the common wealth of Massachusetts and of every other commonwealth in th land dally endure at the hands of Irresponsible combinations which have usurped the power of telling them who may build their house and at what price, whom they may employ and at what wages. It haa become a well known fact that in many cities the workers and the employers in the building trades are in a combination to defraud and tyrannize over the citizens. When a house Is to be built a corrupt circle decides who Is to bid for it at an exorbitant price and what bogu bids are to be put In to support It. The owner is helpless. If he rebels he can find no other contractor to do the work, or, If he does, a strike will put a stop to the endeavor. Similar conditions exist in other lines of bnsi nf. Between the tyrannical rule of the trust on the one hand and the labor union on the other, whether the two work in opposition or In harmony, the average citizen Is helpless. Every action of hi life is controlled by these forces. He Is subjected by them to extortion hln enn- Tenlence, his business, even his health and iife, are ruthlessly sacrificed to their prerogative for which they are more eelnsh, and more ambi tious, and more unscrupulous than King George ever was for th power and prestige of the British Crown. It Is time for educated mea and men of Colonial ancestry to awaka to th danger, and President Eliot performs a public service when he oses his grwt Influence wrer tbcai to work for the aafaguardlofrr.tbcr NKW-YOHK DAILY TRIBUNE, SUNDAY. JANUARY 17. 1904. than the recovery Amprioan liberty from the despotism -whirl has grown up within our own borders. IV IX ADEQUATE PENALTY. Yesterday's issue of The Tribune told in graphic language the story of a runaway in Fifth -a ye. A wine merchant's heavy delivery wag-on, drawn by two big Normandy horses, Ktood baited at Thirty-nlnth-st., while the driver went into a nearby shop to collect a bill. The horses took fright at some street noise and broke on a run down Fifth-aye. Their wild career was not checked until they reached Thirty-second-st On the way down they had thrown traffic in the avenue into a panic, scattered pedestrians, smashed into two passenger vehicles and in jured their occupants, and incidentally endan gered many lives. The driver guilty of leaving the team unwatched on the sidewalk was ar rested, and was discharged on payment of a 5 line. We cannot but think his dismissal with such a penalty a burlesque both on law and on com mon sense. As the event proved, his leaving his team un watched was palpable criminal neg ligence. He had no right to endanger the lives of others in order to do an errand clearly incon sistent with his duties as a teamster. If he was instructed by his employer to collect bills and take chances on the good behavior of his horses, he and the employer were equally guilty of criminal recklessness. Both should be held responsible, in that case, for the injuries their folly was the means of inflicting on innocent passersby. The public is entitled to adequate protection against street perils, and to adequate redress. if those perils are due to the gross and deliberate carlesuess of delivery wagon drivers or deliv ery wagon owners. If a fine of 5 Is the maxi mum penalty for such an offence as that com mitted yesterday in Fifth-aye., our criminal laws should bo revised. They do not now af ford sufficient safeguards against criminal neg lect. i AMBLERS A. YD LAWYER. It is announced that Mr. Richard Cauneld, of Saratoga and New-York, having succeeded in escaping the processes of the criminal courts of this State, has testilied his gratitude to Mr. John B. Stauchfleld, his savior from the toils, by a substantial honorarium of 30,. Saving a gambler comes high. We congratulate Mr. Stanchtield 011 a restitution which enables him to secure that class of clients and command so rich a fee in a case which, to judge from Its Ignominious conclusion, could not have been excessively difficult. Mr. Stanchfield would doubtless have defended a common thief in a much more harder case for far less. If he had consented to lower his dignity by defending a common thief at all. Probably it Is only un common rascals whose freedom from just pun ishment ho would seek to secure. Thirty thousand dollars la a pretty large fee for getting dismissed without trial an indict ment for simply keeping a gambling house. Perhaps it Is based on the theory that the gains of the gambler are ill gotten, and that it is only fair that ho should divide the swag with the lawyer who can keep him going. Anyhow, a gambler cannot expect that a lawyer of high reputation, one who has been a candidate for Governor, will let himself bo mixed up In low associations without plenty of soap with which to wash off the taint afterward. Besides. Mr. Cautleld can take comfort in the fact that he can soon recoup himself from the gilded prts who have money to burn and nro not atlstled unless he takes it from them. Mr. HtanchfleM also. If he stops to think Whether It was worth 30,0X to keep a gambler out of Jail, may le satisfied by the thought that 30, Is easy money for Mr. 'anhVlri. There an persons who will think It beneath the dignity of a man like Mr. StSUKhfleld, and unworthy of the position which he holds in the community, to undertake the defence of the most notorious gambler In America against the efforts of the authorities to drive him out of business. Those person, however, do not un derstand law as she is practised or appreciate the ethics of the bar which make it bight moral in an eminent lawyer to defend the mean est rascal if he has money enough.

The presume which that remarkable nation has gained and hold has probably never been rivalled by that of any other la similar cireum itancea. Men who arc not yet willing to be con sidered id remember when Japan was scarcely open to the world, and had scarcely begun to emerge from barbarism the world gen erally spoke of Japan much as of P.unnah ami Zanzibar and the Fiji Islands. lien still young remember when Japan threw off the fetters of modht'valisin Und adopted a constitutional and representative government. It seems only the other day that extra-terrltorialism was abolished, and all other discriminations, and Japan was treated as the legal peer of other nations. It was two years ago this month that Great Britain took the unprecedented step of making a treaty of alliance with Japan, treat ing the latter with a respect and esteem similar to that which France pays to Roosta in the Dual League or lint which the members of the Triple Alliance pay to each other. To-day, then. Japan stands unchallenged among the great powers Of Hie world. She Is the peer of any of them in legal standing. In sentiment and sympathy she actually outranks at least one of them. There can, we think, lie no doubt thai the preponderance of sympathy the -world over is with her and against her ad versary in the present quarrel. That is to say, Europe and America side with nn Asiatic power of the yellow race against a. Puiopean power largely of the white race. That Is an extraor dinary state of affairs, bat the reason is not dif ficult to discover, it is partly because Japan Is seen to be. fighting the battle of civilization and progress. She is contending for the Inter ests of Europe and America, against Influences that would Impair them. Bat that is not all. Japan Is also seen to be worthy of the esteem she is receiving. That is perhaps the dominant feature of the case. In wise statesmanship, lv shrewd diplomacy, in generous spirit, In earnest desire for peace with justice and honor, and in Intelligent self-control Japan has won the ad miration of the world. It Is to be doubted if any attar nation In similar circumstances has ever acted more creditably In the face of. such conditions the old cry of tho yellow peril rings false. It is still raised, of course, by Japan adversary and would-be oppressor, and by a few others who formerly o committed themselves to it that they cannot now help repeating it. But It Is vain. The whole influenix- of Japan, both in herself and In respect to China and the other yellow peo ples, is so beneficent that other nations are in clined to ay, If ihis be 'peril, let us have more of it Moreover, with vhe examples of Poland, of Finland and of Armenia before it, and with the threat to male another Finland of the whole Scandinavian Peninsula nnd another Po ls p rfc Pnrti ft -rorld hi beginning to ask If the Slavic peril is not greater than the 'yellow one. The necessity of such a choice is not to be considered yet if it were to be, there are plenty of judicious thinkers who would pre fer to see China controlled and wakened and roused to action by Japan rather than by Russia. It may be that neither would be a menace to the world. It seems certain that the former would be the more auspicious for progress and civiliza tion. President Roosevelt urges Congress to take action for the preservation of the big trees. This is a century of big things, and surely the Eiffel towers of the California groves ought not to be neglected. The bill at Albany providing a pension for a Long Island policeman who was shot and made blind in the faithful performance of his duty when he tried to arrest a criminal may com mend itself to the approval of our legislators.

American Move in the Far East Gam c Cha m herlain Co m m issiu n . Sori. to The N'w-York rl'vune by French Cable Copyritfn MM Hi The Tribune Association. London, Jan. 10. Alfred Harmsvvorth has not yet succeeded in bringing on war In the Far East and diverting attention from Pearson's halfpenny mixture of tariff reform and news paper enterprise. The Daily Mail bristles with preparations for war on land and sea, and the corps of correspondents has been organized end maps issued but the first shot has not been fired. There is a momentary pause favorable for peace negotiations, and the tone of the Czar's address to the Japanese Ambassador is distinctly reassuring. The optimism bated on the slight signs of improvement may be iilu lve. for both Japan and Russia may be waft ing time in diplomacy in order to reinforce gar risons and fleets and purchase all the war mate rial in sight. The pessimists take this view, but cannot deny that the Foreign oiflces of Prance and England are laboring in the inter est of peace, that Japan has refrained from ending an ultimatum, that the tone of the Russian press is less warlike, and that the Chi nese government, by opining- three ports to foreign fraae, sWUirr made- her influence felt on the right side. Secretary Hay's ef fective championship of the open door prin ciple has never received sufficient recognition In England, but the newspapers are impressed 1 v it this week, when they find Viscount Hayas-hl associating himself with it, and an nouncing that the Washington agreement in volves the maintenance of Chinese sovereignty and administration in Manchuria. While Eng lishmen have fancied that a checkmate for Rus sia, could only be placed it Downing Street, one of th strongest moves in the game has been made by the American pawn. The United States has lent n.oral support to Japan by securing her admission to the privileges and immunities granted by the Chinese government in Man churlan ports opened to foreign trade, and Rus sian acquiescence has quickly followed the exe cution of the agreement. The rumors raspsjettasj the determination of Russia to violate treaty engagements and send troopships from the Black Sea through the Dardanelles are interesting, if premature. The Indifference of Germany is plainly expressed by the Berlin press. This is a pointer which snows that Oermaiiy, by reason of isolation in Euro pean diplomacy, is thrown back upon Russia, Whose support ehe. must have in future in trigues for the annexation of Denmark. Holland -nd their colonial possessions. Th passage of the Dardanelles, by the conven tion of jTl, is a question which Is determined by th Sultan alone in Time of peace, and It Is not likely that the signatory powers can be induced to r.gree in enforcing the pro hibition In time of war. If the Russian squad ron should attempt to ocme out, even if the Dardanelles were forced, in the face of the protect of the Western powers. Lord Cromer, toy having one or two barges sunk accidentally In the Suez Canal, could obstruct the progress ef the Russian fleet toward Japanese waters.

Legal Proceedings Against the Antitoxin Trust Expected. Chicago. Jar.. 16. Chicago Medical So ciety and the Illinois State Medical Association will, it is expected, begin legal proceedings against the antitoxin trust under the Anti trust law. Secretary Pritchard. of the Health Department, said to-day that he had Informa tion to that effect. He issued the following statement regarding the trust The antitoxin trust i. nothing more or le.-s than a traffic in human life Three eras, which maiufa.-tur- and practically control the antitoxin supply Of almost the entire country, have seen fit arbitrarily to advance the price of their product I'JU per cent. This sri'V i .- was made by Department of Health of the city of Chicago when, In ordering ita needed supplies for Charity work, It was met with ...- Increased quotations. The department felt compelled to call public at tc-ntim to the evidence that a com . baa been formal which effectually controlled the price or the only known remedy for Ihi most dread scourge to the child life of the eeuntiy. Primarily our object was to call attention t xho Immediate effect this would have on the death ran ..f Udrsn in the city of Chicago. Sim-e the discovery of anti toxin the Department at Health haa done all in its power to -'.-.. race its use. It baa furnished its own medical oapecton to administer an. l has piovMed the antitoxin i- all caea where people were too poor to purchase it. . The. bonsontal Increase In 'he price made by the trust means that th.- dty of ' nleago will be com pelled to appropriate double the film to do th sarrf- amount of charity wcrk In diphtheria can in ' J'n4 that It did In .'.'. This th- city can do and doubtless will 10. but outside Ol this It must be mrembered tii.t this burden will fall heaviest on the t.eif-rrsiei ting, f-supporting heads of families of modest incomes To all mu. should diphtheria invade their homes and they be com pelled to iay the Increased price, the MIT Ufa nui upon them by the antitoxin trust will indeed be grievous It should be noted that, the Increased prices quoted by the trust to the city are the prl of th manufacturer to a Jobber. This applied not only t.-, Chicago, but practically to the entlr- oovrt try. The publicity already given has arouse.l the medical profession to the hiKhest Indignation, and will no doubt result in some .t' being speedily taken to provide a supply Of antitoxin from sources other than that of the combine.

Russia is ready to agree to certain points, but on others, the Foreign Office believes. Russia cannot yield. The officials are of the opinion that the way is open for continuing the negotiations, and there is no indication that Russia will seek to delay her answer, which probably will be ready .i a few days. The Czar continues lo talk of peace, and the Czarina Dowager, in conversation, remarked War is a horrible thing. There v ill not be war. In the meanwhile Viceroy Alexieff and Baron de Rosen, as well as the Foreign Office, are studying the Japanese document. Army and navy circles continue pessimistic. The beat feature of the situation is the fact that the Japanese reply has In no sense the character ot. an ultimatum. v f u-hl in pacific terms, does not fix a time limit, and the acceptance by Russia of certain of the propo sitions mark an advance toward a settlement.

Iondon, Jan. 16. 10 frank language Huron Ilayn.shi. nfter consultation with the Foreign Office to-night, summed up the situation as fol lows I only hope the Czar will giv us jxce, but my hopes are not strong. If we go to war it will be for Issues on which both America and Eng land have Insisted diplomatically. We have te ceived no pledges from any country that in the event of defeat it will tep in and save us from being absorbed by Russia. We cannot count even in extremities on the armed .support of any nntion In the world, f would be i struggle to the death. Perhaps we are not strong enough to fight Russia. There are two opinions about that. Karon Hayashl Intimated that he thought Japan was bound to be beaten In the end, and continued If we were beaten Russia would take Corea and Manchuria by right of conquest, and pos sibly Japan. No power on earth could then dis lodge her from Central China and all the Far East. I am sure It is better to go to war when you know you are right, fven If defeat is pos sible, than to see your independence submerged under a continual aggression that Is bound to absorb you eventually. Nothing can avert war between Russia and Japan in futur years, even If peace is procured now, so long as Russia pursues her present Far Eastern poliry. The American action in enforcing the opening of the Miinchuriar. ports was a splendid example of honest diplomacy. It was a straightforward step, which contrasts favorably with Russian methods. No other nation, except Great Britain, when the British Admiralty bought the two Chilian warships, has taken any practical step to live up to its diplomatic demands upon Rus sia anent the Far Kast. We believe we are now fighting a diplomatic battle in behalf of America, and Great Britain, but If only wir can settle it we know We shall receive assistance from neither. We are prepared to fight our own bat tles and take the consequences. HOPES FALL IN PARIS Japan Thought to Have Pressed Her Demands Too Far. Paris. Jan. 16.

Flt'lM THE TRIBI'NE nfltEAC.l Washington, Jan. 10. Senator Hanna, chair man of the Republican National Committee, ar rived in Washington to-day, and immediately Issued the call for the national convention. The expedition with which this matter was finally disposed of is conceded by prominent Republi cans to have bees due to the rumors to which the delay gave rise and to the forcible manner in which they were brought to the attention of the executive committee. Although the date of the call i later than on any occasion in the last quarter of a century, with the single exception of l v '.' when the call vas issued on January it having been cus tomary to issue it about December IS any dis position to criticize has given place to expres sions of gratification that the desired end is finally accomplished.

This evening, however, hi multiplicity of conflict ing reasons Is lost sicht of, and expressions -if satisfaction that the call is jut. are to be heard. The party leaden desire not only to hold early conventions, but to hare ample time In which to attend to the preliminaries, thuj avoiding the dancer f contests and confusion in the national convention.

Sixty-four Men Missing from Ad miral Evans's Fleet. BT TELE'iRAPTt TO THE TRIBfNE.I San Francisco, Jan. 16. When Admiral Evans's fleet sailed for the Orient from Honolulu sev enty-five men from different vessels were left behind. It was supposed at the time that they would return in a few days to the naval station, and then be sent over to join the fleet by the first transport. Only eleven men appeared, and several of these were captured by police. It is certain that sixty-four have deserted, and the theory is that most of them have succeeded In leaving the islands for Port Arthur or Vladi vostok, and there getting places with good pay as gunners iv the Russian navy and at the forti fications. While Admiral Evans's ftVet was at Honolulu local papers published a cable dispatch from China saying that Admiral Alexieff was offer ing high salaries for American and British gun ners. This dispatch is believed to have caused the desertions. WANT TO DEFEAT MAX LEY Enemies Would Place GoCwTtW cm Xational Committee. IBT TELX'.Al'li IO TUB TRIBI NB. Augusta, Me., Jail lft.

It'- That last year's finan cial happenings were hard on the wealthy resi dents of this city is shown by the sworn returns on personal property made to the Board of Re vision of Taxes for 1901. The collapse of Con solidated Lake Superior and Asphalt and the depreciations In value of other .stocks and bonds were responsible for the decrease. It is estimated that the State will lose at least I.XK.tHX In taxes on this class of property. Thomas Dolan, president of the United Gas Im provement Company, furnishes an example of how Philadelphia fortunes have shrunk. Last year he rated his property at 4,082,700 this year it Is f2.134.500.

TOUR OF WEST FOR PARKER XEJr rORK MAS SEXT OUT. To Tell That Section Who the Chief Judge Is. BT TELEf-.RAPH TO THJt TRIBC. Albany. Jan. 16. Just how lars a bureau tot the dissemination of the Parker literature is wording n Albany at the present moment Is a subject of more than passing interest in this city. Of course ex-Senator David B. Hill is in himself no Inconsiderable bareau, and he '.a working all the time, as is his custom, following his own silent, unobtrusive methods. Then, ex- Lieutenant Governor William F. Sheehan Is biquitous. Only last Thursday Judge Parker had a consultation with these political leaders at Wolferfs Roost. Just at present there is a well circulated, rutror that, In addition to the foregoins, N. O. Fanning, a New- York newspaper rr.an. Is en gaged on a missionary tour In the West. It seems that the Parker people are somewhat disturbed by the fact that the first comment they meet with when they suggest their candi date is, Who is Parker To answer that ques tion in the pointed ani concise manner of tha trained newspaper man is, it has been earnest ly affirmed here, the purpose of Mr. Fanninsa Western trip. One thin is certain, and that is thai wtthia a brief time Mr. Fanning has been seen at the. local hotel where Chief Jude Parker lives while in this city, engaged in earnest conversation with him. On the other hand, the fact is not unknown that Mr. Fanning- even In the last few months has given evidence of taking so keen an interest in other political matters of the Democratic stripe as to desire to be present and a part of the inner workings. The declarations of a Tammany Senator on the subject of the attitude of Tammany and th suspicion with which Parker's friendship for ex-Senator Hill was viewed in the Wigwam. printed in Thursday's Tribune, have caused no little comment and some extremely ingenious ex planations nn the parr of the Chief Judge's friends. They declare eagerly that it la only the effort of Tammany to make people think they are against Parker, because they realize that the Democrats will not accept any man of Mur phy's organization. The leLthanded compliment for Tammany, on whoso votes Judge Parker has to depend to an this State, if he can carry it at all, is worthy of notice, and has not escaped the comment of Tammany people themselves. There is in all this a certain element of hu mor that the Republican leaders here have not failed to appreciate, chief Judge Parker, ac cording to the frank declaration of the Tam many Senator, quoted recently in The Tribune, must break away from ex-Senator Hill, because the country is host to KilL On the other hand, on the assurance of Judge Parker's friends. there is no hope of his nomination un less Tamn-.any makes a decent appearance, at least, of opposing him. Where, then, is Parker inquired a well known Republican legislator to-day. What a joyful task Mr. Fanning has before him In the West, in explaining how JwhjS Parker is re moved from both Hill and Tammany just enough to be desirable as a candidate and yet not enough to be in danger of the fraternal Democratic knifing system Local rumor has it that Mr. Fanning hi in the West. I should think he would be at sea. PARKER TO MEET BRYAX. They Will Be Guests at the Holland Society Dinner. Chief Judge Alton B. Parker of the Court of Appeals, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Is for this first time to meet William J. Bryan at the dinner of th Holland Society at the Waldorf-Astoria, on Janu ary XL The interesting tning about the meeting Is that. according to Mr. Bryan's friends, the arrangement for the meeting were made at the request of Jutls Parker himself. While It may not be safe to attach much political significance to the meeting of the two men at a social dinner, still It is regarded as significant that there should be any apparent eagerness on the part of Ju.ln Parker's ftteatfi to have the judge meet the twice, defeated candidate for President at this time. Mr. Bryan will respond to the toast Peace at tlv .'.inner, and It bejjlna to look as i academla peace at dinner gatherings is about the only brand that is to be on view among Democrats this year. One o Judge Parker's admirers, in commenting on the prospective meeting of Ihs Xebraaisan and the Judge, said last night It is becoming more and more apparent that under the antiquated and senseless two-third rua obred by the Democrats in the choosing of the Presidential candidates Mr. Bryan and his ifnme UUite friends will be ble u dominate the next convention.

Russia stronger In heavy ves sels and Japan In torpedo boats. An indication that public feeling Is aroused In the Interior Is shown by a dispatch from Kos troma, 230 miles from Moscow, saying that when orders were received y the local bat talions calling for twenty-four additional re cruits for service In the Far East several hun dred men responded. Referring to the reported Intention of China to remain neutral In cas of war between Rus sia and Japan, tbe Vedomosti says A direct declaration of war by China would be much preferable to dubious neutrality, com pelling Russia to take the same precautions as In wartime without permitting an invasion of Chinese territory. If war Is declared, the Vedomostr further asserts, the question of Manchuria could be nettled forever by Its annexation aa a conquered country. CZAR AGAIN AT ST. PETERSBURG. St. Petersburg. Jan. 26.

ARMY COMMENT ON PROMOTION S- of th urmv offlcera In Washington, In look ing over th list of promotions, criticised th.' pro motion and retirement ol General A. E. Bates, pay master general, us not Justified by military prece dent if the action was to be construed us a reward of that officer, who was graduated from West Point after the lv ii War. The promotion, however, aa commended for the opportunity It gave for the d vancement Of Colonel F. B. Dodge, an oillcer of Croat distinction and military activity. There was also boom criticism of General O. L,. Oillespie. wbose promotion to major general caused the ap pointment aa chief engineers of Colonel Alexander Mackenzie, one of the ablest officers of the army. 11 . a notable feature of these nominations thut Colonel Mackensie was not a candidate for pron-.0 tton. having replied to the tempting proposition of advancement over tho beads of three colonel that he would not seek the place. The decision to make him chief, of engineers was reached while Mackenzie was on an official trip to Hawaii. Line officers think that the place of major general and the billet of assistant chief of staff should have been reserved for a lino colonel or a genera officer, and not tilled by transfer of the chief of a staff corps. Tho appointnu nt of Colonel J. V. Story to bo chief of artillery elves pleasure to Cat officer's friends because be really takes his old place m relation to the two colonels he now jumps. When Story was graduated from West Point his class mates were Colonels Charles Morris and a. M. Mills, who have been senior to him In the artil lery corps. At the time of the graduation, in 167, they stood relatively Story. Mills ana .Morris. la the days of regimental promotion the order was Changed so that on the consolidation of the artil lery arm into a corps those class associate stood with Morris first. Mill second and Story third. His appointment to be brigadier general and to the place of chief of artillery Is consequently accepted as an Instance where an officer Injured by the in equalities of regimental promotion comes Into his P Bome criticism was also made of the appoint ment of Colonel A. L. Milla as a brigadier general. 'mat officer Is colon, l only by virtue of being BO perintendent of the Military Academy, to which duty ho wan assigned while a first lieutenant of cavalry on account of exceptional urunt ser vice In Cuba. Some diligent gtatlstlclan In the War Department has discovered that Mills practically takes precedence over b3O officers whose names are ahead of his on the relative rrink list. Much specu lation was heard to-day regarding the future duty of Colonel Mills. The Impression prevails that ha will continue as superintendent of the Military Academy, where be ha.- been a most useful otliciai. Under his administration the Institution has been extremely prosperous. The fact that m recent years th- West Point super intendency was considered a proper billet for a lieutenant colonel or colonel la not now considered to prevent continuing Co.onel Mills there as a brigadier general. It was expected that one of the appointments to the 'place of biljrudier general would be that or Colonel B. II Crowder. Judge advocate who waa on the original list In anticipation of the promo tion and retli men t as a major general of Brigadier General Q. M. Kandnll. The latter has. however, refused to ko on the retired list, and Crowder was not promoted. The secret of this change in tho programme lies in the fact that Randall has re ceived the promise of a major generalship on the retirement of General Gespie. and he liaa a day margin to gt the higher rot . .

I HOPS SIX FOR IIAZIXG. Sophomore Class at Wesley an Uni versity Criticises the Faculty. Mlddletown, Conn.. Jan. President Ray mond of Wesleyan University to-night suspend ed fix members of th- sophomore class until the midyear examinations In February. The students are charged with being connected with the hazii of a fellow Student la.st month. The students suspended are Arthur K. Dearborn, Mlddletown Clarence B. Hancock, Syracuse, N. V. Arthur J. Hanloi . Canaan, Conn. Arthur J. Munroe, BratUeboro, vt Frank H. Byrett, Mont. lair. N. J. and Ralph M. Ce. Totten ville, N. Y. The students are ordered to leave Mlddletown not later than Saturday night. The trouble had Its beginning in th.- attempt of a number of sophomores to base Prank B. Taylor, of Cambridge, Mass., on the night of December 10 last. On their first attempt to en ter his room Taylor frightened away his tor mentors with a revolver, but they returned later In the. evening and attempted to break down the door. Taylor, fearing he would be injured, picked up a screwdriver and began to fight his way through the crowd. In doing so he struck Howard Richards, of New-Haven, just over the eye, Infill ting an Injury which resulted m Rich ards losing the sight of the eye. The affair was brought to the attention of the faculty, and to day's action resulted. The students, after learning of the siisponslona, held a meeting, at which they drew up resolu tions disapproving the action of the faculty on the grounds that to single out six men of the Class was unjust, there having been many more students Implicated in the hazing. President Raymond refused to discuss the case to-night, but fuid that the Incident was not yet closed. A SUICIDE FOR 3,. Senator Clark's Representative Could Not Get a liaise to 12,.

JAPAN DEFERS CONFLICT, NEGOTIATIONS TO GO ON. Russia's Reply Unsatisfactory, but Does Not Warrant War. Tokio, Jan. 8. The Japanese government has practically determined to continue negotiations. It is dissatisfied with Russia's terms, but doea not feel warranted In issuing an ultimatum or breaking off negotiations, and will make another effort to secure their modification before resort ing to force. It is anticipated that the discussion will con sume a few weeks, and in this interim a breach of the peace is very improbable. The Elder Statesmen of Japan did not hold a conference to-day, but will probably meet to morrow. In the mean while the wildest rumors are current. The press unanimously demands that the gov ernment take decisive action, thereby prevent ing Russia from gatemg advantages by further dilatory tactics. The people repose confidence In the govern ment's ability to meet th situation. JAPAN TO KEEP COREA. Reported Terms of Far Reaching Russian Concessions. Berlin, Jan. B. The Tageblatfs Paris cor rfspendent learns that the French government has been informed that Russia's answer to Japan makes far reaching concessions respecting Corea, and that these concessions are equivalent to permitting the occupation of Corea by Japan, on lines somewhat similar to the position of Great Britain in Egypt, hut that Russia flnrly rejects any right of Japan to mingle in affairs in Manchuria. Paris. Jan. B. lt is learned that. In the opinion of the French government, there i 3 still a chansa of avoiding a conflict between Russia and Ja pan aa a result of a concession made by Russia in her last note. The dispatches which hay come to Parl3 from all Quarters to-day have been moat pessimistic, and the hopefulness of the government Js in strong contrast with them. It appears that Russia's concession rotates to the recognition of the preponderance of the in terests of Japan in Corea. This has been the crux of the question between the two powers up to the present moment. Just how far the concession goes It is Impossibla to learn, but th effect in Tokio. according to the Information ob tained, has been more satisfactory than the press dispatches show. In connection with Russia's concession, an odd and at the same time authoritative story la told regarding the cause oT the jwelopment of tha present situation. It appears that a misunder standing ocmiied between Viceroy AlexiefT and the Russian government, and that the note antedating the ore just submitted did not con tain a recognition of Japanese preponderating intlunce in any part of Corea. A3 Russia and the whole world believed. Th last note of Rus sia clean up the situation, but whether It recog i.izes Japan's preponderating interests In all Corea is not lenown. MANY GUARDS AT SEOUL.

It is anticipated that In case of a military revolt the Emperor will take refusre in one of the European legations. London. Jan. 9. The correspondent of Tha Dally Mail at Seoul, says that guards for the foreign legations are still arriving there, and that twenty British, forty American and thirty Russian guards have already reached the cap ital.

Kurlno, the Japanese Minister, to-night authorized The Associated Press to say that the Japanese government waa still doing everything in its power in the in terests of peace, and that all reports about th sending of troops to Corea were without founda tion. Minister Kurino said he thought that the negotiations had made some progress. A similar statement was made at the Japanese Legation in Paris. WAR THOUGHT NEAR.

United States Senator fressjl North Dakota, who la at the Fifth Avenu Hotel, said last night that his State and thai States adjacent to it are enthusiastically bd favor of the nomination of President Roosevelt next June, and that no other Presidential boom is heard in the Northwest.

As a Presidential candidate, however. I think he Is generally regarded, as much, weaker than Presi dent Roosevelt. He is not so much a man oS the people.

The report that Governor Odell was to resume the office of chairman of the Statt Committee, which was revived yesterday, drew ous, a multitude of conflicting comments, all unofficial since the Governor was out of the city. Tha flrsSJ fact recalled by those familiar with the situation was that when the publication of the same story by a weekly magazine some time ago was called toi the attention of Governor Odell. ho said, with ap-4 parent amusement 'Well. I'm not responsible for the suggestions og newspapers, am I Since that time. and. in fact, prior to that, thai same suggestion had been gravely considered an argued. Ilall this time the Governor has been almost tho only person who has not discussed It. The apparent reasoning of those who hold thai opinion Is that the Governor is the man whose ex perience and familiarity with conditions of a Stata campaign and the organization of a party cajivi best qualify him to lead the lighting. The faca that hia generalship contributed so much to tat election of Mr. Roosevelt In the close election oS 1398 and the fact that he personally directed the laaS week of SSB own canvass SI New- York City In thai last State ca.mpnsm. supply the necessary login for his resumption of the office.

The argument that such an action on the part of tho Governor would be contrary to precedent Is, however, denied, and the statement is made tli.it Governor Cornell exercised both functions.

I an teettne ell and full of fight, said Mr. jryan, with a BisnUleaat gleam in his eyes as the referred to the campaign to be fought this Bear. The ... legacy which his friend Bennett, pf New-Haven, left him and which the courts aye withheld from him was to have made it j,osslble for Mr. Bryan to exploit his political MbwOi He may not get the money, but he Hi-11l devote himself . spreading his political sjosrel Just as if the ISQu were in a trust Itompany and subject to his personal draft. W. Bourke Obduan was at Mr. Bryan's po- Qitlcal levee, and In a ten minute speech paid flowing- tribute to th NVbraskan, welcoming Biim bad to the land he loves back to the clti eenship he adorn, to use Mr. Cockran's own ji'.-ords. Edward M. Shephard, the caustic gold bug Democrat, who helped to defeat Bryan In 1896, was there with his paean of praise for the re turning traveller. Ex-Senator Towne. Senator P. H. McCarren. Dohn B. Crosby, General Weaver, of lowa, and City Judge Seabury all took up the chorus of en romlums, making Mr. Bryan forget that he was ''in the enemy's country. Altogether it was as remarkable a tribute to lr. Bryan's winning personality as any poli tician has had paid to him in many a long day. True, there were some remarkable things said. Senator McCarren, for instance, who aspires to the chairmanship of the Democratic -National Committee, gave voice to the. most elastic code Df political morals ever put on exhibition In this rite There are many kinds of morality, policies und principles. said Mr. McCarren. When principles, policies and morality are riot of the proper kind I believe in changing them to suit the occasion, but I believe in changing them in tide the party lines. To a remarkable assemblage assemblage In which were men who, though Democrats, did not support a Democratic Presidential candl flate, and Republicans who did men high in the council of both parties at different times Mr. Bryan made an appeal for a spirit In politics which should work, not for the good fcf party but for the upbuilding of the nation, For a high standard of morality, personal and political, he plended. Strong in the faith that t.ir parly was the best in the la. id. and he'd the doctrine best for that land, he wanted bo much the welfare of that land, he said, that If the Dther party could give doctrines better than his party, plans for a wiser administration of af fairs than the leaders of his party could, then would his party not deserve the public respect and the other party should have the public support. The only thing approaching a boom was sprung by Senator MCarren, who announced hat he had voted for Mr. Bryan on two occa sionF, and would again if the necessity arose. He took some of the bloom off the rofe by de rlaririr that he had done so only because Mr. Bryan happened to be the candidate of the erri'cratJ- rarty. Th- reception last night took place in the larse writing room on the main Boar of the Victoria. A little after S o'clock Colonel Bryan entered the writing room, escorted by several BMenbers of the committee. Among th-m were fx-Pnfttor Ford and Dr. Albert Shaw. T.. greet him there was a large assemblage, in hich were James D. F.ell, Congressman Robert Baker. Hamlin Oarland. Henry George, Benry A. OouMen. Controller Orout. Justice Oaynor, Haroh a. Cantor, W.

VEL.DEMERS. A. I CAUGHT IX FURIOUS STORM. The vessel was a regular dally passenger Packet. She made moderately good progress across the Straits, bound for Victoria, until Trial Island, off the entrance to the harbor, was abeam. Then a terrific cross sea was pelting the vessel, retarding her progress and making life uncomfortable for those aboard. Little fear j was manifested, however, until word came up j from below that the vessel was leaking. Inves- ' tigation showed that the waves on the wind- '. ward side had stove In a deadlight, through j which the water rushed in volumes, resisting all effort to stop it. Seeing the efforts futile, the safety at the passengers particularly the women and chil- j dren, was looked after, and all bo desired were ' X Off fron the Mmer In the boats. The ' heavily laden boats were thrown about wildly In the choppy sea. and one after another, after i succeeding in getting away from the vessel. ' were either capsized or swamped. ALL WOMEN AND CHILDREN LOST. The terrible fury of the storm is attested by the fart that not a woman or child of nil thos ' on board lived to tell th tale. An apparent di- ercnaney in numbers from the list of fatalities is accounted for by the fact that only the chil- j dren who paid half fare were on the passenger i list. In the mean time word had come from Vie- ' toria of the vessel's predicament. and powerful tugs were dispatched to render assistance. The j Richard Holyoke. in command of Captain Rob- i crt Hall, was the urst to reach the Clallam. I which had by this time careened partly over ' from the inrush of water, which had put the engines out of commission. The Holyoke reached the Clallam about 11 o'clock last night and about 1 a. m. succeeding In getting a hawser aboard, with which she started to tow the Clallam to safety. The dsJlam took a heavy j lurch, ar.l those remaining aboard were com- pelled to climb up the side to safety, finally i reaching the roof of the pilot house. SURVIVORS RESCUED BY TUG'S BOATS. Without a moment's hesitation the tug's boats were lowered and the work of rescue began At this point the tug Sea Lion. Captain Hunter arrive.d. and her mm rendered valuable as sistance. Before all the struggling people had been taken off the riallam began to break up and soon afterward went down. All possible assistance to the rescued people was given by the two shipmasters and their crews and the i tugs hurried to Port Townsend. The surviving i passengers and the remainder of the crew then ' took passage on the Dirigo. bound for Seattle STORY OF A SURVIVOR. W. H. Grimes, of Redmond, Wash . aboard the Clallam, bound for Victoria, gives a conciao I statement. The weather was. pretty rough. he i said, but we- had no suspicion of danger until MOM one forward said something about life pre servers. I went forward to Investigate, and there learned that the Clallam was making water rapidly. Th 1 oats were promptly manned and launched, and the women and chil- I dren and ruch re-ngers a desired to leave were placed in them, competent crown being In i charge. The boats made off from the steamer ' safely, but ore after another they capsized, nnd we v. er-- helpless to render them any assistance, They simply drowned before our eyes. In the I mean time crew and prissenpers were busy ball- i inp and trying to atop the leak, but without I success. The balling was kept up, however, and I Boon we were overjoyed to learn that a big tug had hold of us. The towboat started and made pretty good progress until It became apparent that the steamer v.as careening under us. Then j all hands went on deck, and as the ill fated packet lifted we gradually crawled up on her ex- posed side, from which the brave fellows from th Holyoke rescued most of us. i Prominent among thos- known to be aboard and unaccounted for Is Homer Swaney, iron and I steel plant promoter and owner of valuable iron properties in British Columbia. He boarded the vessel here and was not among the rescued. When the Clallam was launched at Tacoma, last April, the bottle of champagne was not I broken, but fell and slid down along the side of the vessel. Old seamen predicted that disaster j would overtake the vessel within a year, and It ' v.as said at the time that it would be a diffi- j cult matter to secure a crew to man her.

SUNDAY. JANUARY 10. 1904,-FliFrF PAGEs BROADSIDE FOR JEROME- Chicago Judge Says Words Dis grace Office Talks. Chicago. Jan. Judge Edward F. Dunne de- llvered a broadside from the bench to-day against the sentiment reported to have ben expressed by District Attorney Jerome, of New- York, regarding the rough handling of crook. A law defying, crime inciting utterance from a public official charged with the preservation of the peace. was the opinion expressed by Judge Dunne of District Attorney Jerome' re ported plan Of treating lawbreakers. Judge Dunne gave utterance to this entlment aftr Robert K. Cantwefl, an attorney, had rep resented in the court that a prisoner who was asted and subsequently charged with com plicity in several murder and robberies had been roughly handled by the police. Men In Mr. Jerome's position should not be guilty of uttering suh Incendiary and ilrgl sentiments. continued Judge Dunne. It is most outrageous, unworthy of tfct iiun irvj disgrace to ills office. I iir sstonfjded 1 M' Jerome, as I have always believed himt be a vigorous prosecutor and an honest man. It . Imply Inciting police officers to commit crine. The opinion 1 have expressed about District Attorney Jerome is based on the assumption that h whs correctly quoted as saying that 'most of the men charged with crime with us, when brought into court, bear evidence of re sisting an offl'-er. We nee to it that these men do resist officers, or we force them to resist and then bring them in In fragments.' The interview referred to hns also been caus tically criticised by Mayor Harrison. The Mayor said advice to beat up prisoners rm with a poor grace from a law officer. In a subsequent interview. Mr. Jerome is quoted In reply to Mr. rrlson as follows I did not say that I Indorsed the methods of the Mew-York police in handling crooks, but I did say. and I know, that rough handling- ha abated crime to a grent extent. If good has been accomplished there is some excuse for the means employed. Mr. Jerome came to Chicago to deliver an ad dress at the. Merchants' Club. He will leave for New-York to-morrow morning.

He saved your life, and still you will not grant the continuance, Governor Johnson is quoted as saying. No said Mr. Folk, startled by the dramatic statement from Governor Johnson. I do not know what you mean, but I have my duty to do, and it must tie done. Then Mr. Johnson told part of the story. The men indicted for boodlinp held dally meeting, it is said, and a resolution to the effect that Folk must be gotten out of the way was passed. Faulkner won not present at the meeting at which the resolution was adopted, but was in formed what had been done and who had been chosen to do the work and. protested against the plan. He was laughed at for a time, hut finally won n majority to his side. Governor Johnson declined to-night to make a statement. I don't think I should do it, he Bald, because It might hurt others besides Mr. Faulkner. I mentioned the matter to Folk be cause 1 thought hr- should know.

Jan. The Democratic State Com mittee, nt a meeting here to-day, indorsed a movement in favor of having the national con vention of the party nominate Richard Olney. of this city, for President of the United States. After speeches In praise of Mr. Olney's record hnd been made by Congressman William S. Mi Nary, chairman of the committee Charles S. Hrr.lln. of Boston, formerly Assistant Secre tary of the Treasury ex-Congressman John C. Crosby, of Pittsfleld, and other, resolutions were adopted Inviting Democrats throughout the country to work in favor of such a move ment. When the resolutions were first presented. however, Qerce opposition developed, and they were bitterly fought. The opposition was con ducted us though th Bry '-Williams men who rre on the committee were under orders to fight . Olney, and the dream of a solid New- England f m likely to IM destroyed. The resolu tfL i-Sw The Democratic State Committee of Massachu setts herewith place upon record its apprecia tion of the eminent services rendered the Demo cratic party and the nation by Richard Olney, and expresses Its firm conviction that under his leadership in the coining Presidential ram paU-i Important New-F.rmland States will swing over into the Democratic colmun. and the na tional party will a. hl.-ve a sweeping victory, Insuring a speedy reform of the abases following a continuance in power of the Republican party and the re-eafabliihment of those fundamental principles of government which that party has deliberately and flagrantly violated. To this end we Invite the co-operation of the Democrats of New-England and of the nation. These resolutions were introduced by Con gressman McXary. who classed Mr. Olney as one of the foremost Americans and foremost Democrat. 1 He thought that if th.- Democrats were to win this year they must carry the East ern States. It appeared, he said, that Mr. Oiney was strong In New- York and New-Jersey and that he would be acceptable to those States. New- York not having any candidate, the nom ination fa man from New-England, and that man Mr Olney. would have the immense advan tage to the Democrats of establishing a large Eastern area where the scales rou'il ha turned in favor of the Democratic nominee. Mr. Oiney would be Htrong In Illinois and Connecticut. In closing Mr. McNary thought that Mr. Oiney would receive at the polls the great independent vote of the country. Mr. Hamlln. In favoring the resolution, spoke in a strain similar to Congressman McXary. He referred to the advantages which would ac crue from nominating a New-England niaji. He traced Mr. Olney's career, and spoke of Mr. Olney's achievement in the Venezuela affair when he had forced England to arbitrate the Venezuelan question. He declared that as Sec retary of State under President Cleveland he had been the protector of the South American republics, when other administrations have been In effect their oppressors. Mr. Hamlin added Mr. Oiney is a man of sterling Democracy and of rugged character. Under his leadership several States of New- England may be counted upon for the Democrats. Under his leadership j the Democratic party will sweep the country. Commltteemaj O'Gara said that until Mr. Oi ney nad named Mr. Cleveland for the next can didate h favored Mr. Oiney. but now he was fa vorable o William It. Hearst. Mayor Feeney of Woburu believed that the resolutions were not in order. Both these committeemen withdrew their objections and voted with the rest in favor of the resolutions , Previous to the consideration of the resolutions the annual election of officers resulted as fol lows Chairman, William S.

FRANCHISE TAX ADVANCE Increased Valuation Will Raise Levy About One-third. Albany. Jan. 9.-The action of the Board of Assessors of New-York City in greatly increas ing the assessed valuation of real estate in that municipality will materially affect the amount of special franchise taxes that corporations operating in that city will be required to pay ur.der the Ford law. It is probable that their , assessments will be increased about one-third I Of course, this is dependent on a decision of j the United States Supreme Coi-rt sustaining the I decision of the Court of Appeals of this state. which held the Franchise Tax law to be con stitutional. In the equalization of the valuation of real , estate in this State among the several counties I the State Board of Equalization has rated the valuation for New-York City at per cent that is, it has held that the local assessors val ued that class of property at 67 per cent of its actual or market value, in 1NT8 the local as sessors of New- York increased the total value of real estate from IU3MT.IR9 to 91181.. f-r0.826. an increase of 51.4.H93,247. or about one-third. The Special Franchise Tax law provides that the value of the special franchises shall be j fixed by the State Board of Tax Commissioners j at full value.- The courts, in construing the law. decided that the assessment should be at the rate at which other classes of real estate are assessed in the same locality. Under that i decision the assessments placed on franchises operated in New-York City will be reduced about one-thin. When the State Board of Equalization pre pares Its next equalization table the rate for New- York City 'will be increased in consequence of the Increased valuation made by the assessors of that city. It Is estimated that the next equal ization table will rate New-York at 75 instead of 67 per cent. Thus, in the readjustment of special franchise tax valuations in that city In the future the reduction will be about 25 in stead of 33 per cent. It is learned here to-day that the corporations of New- York City which are parties to the liti gation attacking the special franchise tax act in j the Federal Supreme Court are practically tha i enly large corporations which have not yet paid their taxes under the law. The amount of I money due from these corporations Is estimated at between ln.iOn.iiNj and SI'J... The exact figures cannot be ascertained, because the j amount due depends not only on the assessment j made, but also on reductions to be made under i the Court of Appeals decision and the additions I for Interest. In most up-State counties the cor j porations and the assessors have gone into court j and secured orders adjusting the assessments i pursuant to the Court of Appeals decision. It Is impossible to obtain a record of the corporations which have paid their tax, or the amounts paid j because that is a transaction local to th taa j district In which each franchise operates, th duties of the State Tax Commissioners ceasing i when they have valued the franchises.

N. who were fouVl on their dismasted and sinking vessel about four hundred miles off the coast. The men were taken off the schooner with great difficulty, and within an hour after they were on board the steamer their own vessel foundered stern first. The Provan landed her commander. Captain Jones, at Algiers, seriously ill with Inflamma tion of the bowels, and came Into port under Chief Officer Ford. On her way across the At lantic she ran Into three separate storms, all from the west-northwest, the severest being that of Sunday last, which compelled the steamer to lay to for twenty-four hours. The Smith was sighted on Wednesday last, and on running down to her five men were seen huddled on the poop. The Provan was laid up to the windward of the little schooner, and the chief officer, the boatswain and three men put off in a lifeboat, which was rowed alongside the schooner. One by one the men dropped off Into j the sea and were hauled aboard. Before the last man left the wreck the schooner was set on fir, but this proved unnecessary, as she foundered within an hour. The men had been on the deck of the vessel without food or water for two clays, and had given up all hope of rescue. They will be sent to their homes in Nova Scotia by the British Consul.

Jan. 9. -Japan addressed a note to Row sla to-day, through Baron de Rosen, the Russian Minister. Its character has not been iTI but it Is said that Japan requires an answer wthlna given number of days. Whether the note mentions the time, making the document an ultimatum, or whether the Urn is intimated otherwise, hi unknown. The government, how ever, id determined to obtain an early response and close the discussion if it should prove to be fruitless. It Is understood that Japan adheres closely to her original contentions, and it is believed that if Russia falls fairly to meet the demands, war will ensue. The attitude of the British and Americans greatly encourages the Japanese war spirit, which Is stronger than ever. The meeting of the Elder Statesmen has bee deferred for a day or two. The Russian warships which left Vladivostok recently are reported to have returned there, in stead of proceeding to Port Arthur, as expected. Despite the general Impatience there is no public excitement here. Saseho, twenty-five miles from Nagasaki, la full of officers and their families and friends, who are bidding them farewell. The suggestion contained In a dispatch from Berlin of the possible partition of Corea between Japan and Russia meets with no acceptance here. The Japanese officials regard It as further evidence of German support of Russia. NO MEDIATION WANTED. Suggestion Not Taken Seriously by Russian Government. St. Petersburg, Jan. 9. The suggestion of th intervention of other powers in the Far East ern situation is regarded aa premature In diplo matic circles here. It is not considered seriously, and It is pointed out that the Russo-Japanese ne gotiations are not broken off. Th opinion here is that any proposition of intervention would be useless and probably harmful. The Forelsrn Office thinks that the only possi bility in this connection would be the attempt of the Western powers to impress on Japan the serious consequences of war. and It is added that for its part the Russian government does not need advice. CHINA TO RE NEUTRAL, Prince Citing's Conference zcitk the Japanese Minister. Peking, Jan. 9. The Japanese Minister to China. M.

Prince Ching announced that China had decided to maintain neutrality, and expressed great interest in the nature of the Russian reply recently transmitted to- Japan. M. Uchida was non-committal on this subject. It Is reported here that Japan is chartering many more commercial ships for use as naval colliers and supply vessels. JAPAX'S WARSHIPS SAIL.

The N'lasin sailed half an hour later, apparently going in th- direction of Naples, but no one kns whan route they will take, even the commanders be fore leaving taftg acknowledged that they were in the dark regarding the instructions con tained In their sealed orders. The general opin ion, however, is that they will go through th Suez Canal.

WAR PARTY DISCREDITED. Cause of Russian Moderation- ise of Russian Moderation Terms of Reply. Paris, Jan. 9. The Temps this evening stiver prominence to a statement purj.ortin.Jr to come from important private Russian .sources x plainlnsr Russia's present pacific tendencies. It asserts that M. Bezobrazoff. who has been looke l upon as the leader of the Russian war party, ' recently incurred the hostility of the Grand Duke Alexander. and that the duke, who strenu ously opposes war with Jipun, suee- r in im pressing his views on the Czar. The paper i adds that, as a result of the personal feeling ' aroused by the Incident. M. Bezobrazoff request j ed leave to go abroad, and Intends to leave St. I Petersburg in the next two or three days, thus confirming previous London and St. Petersburg reports that M. Bezobrazoff had lost the favor of the Czar. Official advices received here this morning fur- I ther convince these In the highest authority I that the Russo-Japanese war crisis has been I averted, at least for the present, and that the situation is again brought '.-. within th- lines of diplomatic adjustment. Reports, chiefly from Tokio. but also from St. Petersburg, '. a clear view of the circumstances leading to th sudden improv-.-ient in the situation.

The Seaiate's Tote on the Panama Canal treaty will solve a mystery which has beeu made much of in recent Washington dispatches. Gossip at tbe capital has concerned Itself with tbe probable action of those Bouthern Senators wbose States hare evinced a positive and gen wl desire to hare the pending treaty ratified r.d work begun as soon as possible ou a water way across tbe isthmus. Two Southern States -lann and Mississippi have expressed thdr legislatures their hearty approval cf ttbt cana convention. Tbe Louisiana Legis lature, by a unanimous vote in each branch, instructed Senators MEnery and Foster to wtpport the treaty. The Mississippi Legislature, by large majorities in each house, passed a resolution requesting Senators Money and McLaurin to vote for ratification. In other States, whose legislatures are not in seisiosi, popular pressure in behalf of ratification has been brought through boards of trad and other rommercla bodies. Texas is represented by two Senators who have declared, in response to appeals from non -political organizations, that they will follow their own Ideas and defeat raMflatlun. if they can, no matter what their ronsrituenta think or wish. Tbe Mississippi and Louisiana Senators have not publicly com mitted themselves. But talk is beard to the fleet that Messrs. Money aud McLaurin may finally decide to ignore the Mississippi Legis lature's request Bow far instructions to United Stntes Sen ator aboald be honored is, of course, a prob lem quite Incapable of tettlement. Our un rrftten constitution furnishes no hard-and fast rul Precedents conflict and a Senator U left by custom to obey or ignore the wishes of h's State Legislature as bis own sense of ex ftwdfeory or obligation may dictate. The South ern strict-construction. State's rtjruts school, which considered each Senator the ambassador f a sovereign power, adopted tbe rijfld view of his ambassadorial ohlljrntlon. John Tyler, u. logical exponeut of that doctrine, resigned his saat when tio Virginia Leglslnture instructed him to vot. to expunge the famous resolution .r oonsuro dlroed at President Jackson. But Jew men In public life have pone to that ex trtme. Many Senators have necer-ted intmc tlon mid exefTited them. Others, nmon th-m tfumncr cn,l Lamar, hare oprnlj defied dicta tion of this No one will now .-..-.tn.i that n. S.n-it r .', by th wlsb of a pnlltloAily lOHJte lMaw. senator William Lindsay SOQ rpTiy flenlod tbe rlsht of ti, K n . mcfcjr Leglatn to control his vote on tbe pnthy with his own fl-1a viewg. He even went further and laid down this general prin ciple I do not exercise my Senatorial duties fcubject to leidslative supervision, ror hold my place at the legis.'ativo will. ' Yet another Senator Mr. Perkins, of California voted at the succeeding session to ratify the treaty of pen- witli Spain against bis personal judg ment and in deference to au expression of opinion from the legislature of California. It eot be held that there is any com pulsion in a resolution of msiructions. But the wise statesman will defer to it when he can, and defy it only when he must and in defying it he n required to plant himself on tomr- solid ground of logic or of morals. A convincing demonstration of lofty purpose Is oertninJy the least that can be expected of the Senators from Mississippi and Louisi.ina. If they refuse to co-operate In an undertaking v.-hlch ther constituencies hare so deeply and earnestly fit heart. TEE EDUCATIONAL SCBZME. The educational establishment bill ou wheh leading members of the Senate and Assembly are said to have agreed, and widen is supposed to embody the filial views of the joint legis lative committee and to have received the Got ernor's approval, may not pass fo easily as some of its advocates expect. It might. In fact, be a risky proceeding to push through In a hurry, as hero is talk of doing, a measure of the Bret Importance relating to a matter us to which there baa been a wide divergence of official aad general opinion for years and until within a few days. We hope that most of those who have engaged iu the long contro versy will be ready t. admit that tnc proposed scheme has some excellent features. If enact ed and carried out lu good faith. It would eventually accomplish h veritable unification of school control, which has always been the earnest desire of Intelligent and disinterested citizens of this State. But it appear to us that in Its present form them may be o'ojectlona whica require careful consideration. Possibly they wauld prove less formidable than they now look. Perhaps It might lc found that an attempt to change the scheme materially would arouse fatal opiosition to any plan for getting rid of existing evils. In which case it would be judicious to weigh the comparative advantages of keeping on in the old way or of adopting a new way also faulty. At all events, Impartial discussion, inspired by a conscientious purp to do the best thing for the State, ou'bt to precede legislative action. The opinion is held by some lawyers of repute that Kegeuts of the University, elected for life In conformity with the statute, cannot be con stitutionally ejected from office at tbe pleasure of the legislature. If that question should bo formally raised by any of the Regents, or by anybody else, for that matter, thoe who like to make trouble under a pretence of helpfulness would infallibly repeat the shabby misrepre sentation that such Regeuts are selfishly re solved to keep their places at all hazards. The fact is that few of the Regents would person ally object to being lawfully relieved of the unsolicited duties which were Imposed upon them by the legislature and whiih they huve performed to the best of their ability at con siderable sacrifice. Still, the question of con stitutionality ought to be intelligently consid ered In advance, Instead of being left to pro duce, perhaps, serious embarrassment here after. There is another important consideration re lating to the Intrinsic merits of the plan pro posed. The ostensible desire of all who have joined in the educational dispute has been to take and keep politics out of tbe schools. But a moment's reflection suggests the Inquiry, per tinently raised In our Albany correspondence yesterday, whether the election of an entirely new board by the present legislature, and the selection of an entirely new superintendent by the present legislature, and the organization of an entirely new 6ystem under the present legislature, do not seem to put the whole school system of the State, secondary edui-a tlon as well as primary, more completely in the hands of the politicians than ever. Un doubtedly, fortunate results under such an ar rangement are attainable, and we hope that its sponsors are resolved to secure them. If a man fully qualified in all respects for the new commissionershlp of education should receive and accept tbe appointment there might be nothing to regret But if tbe legislature, either owing to unforeseen complications or by pre vious contrivance, should be compelled or per suaded to fall back on an unsuitable candidate the fixed condition of things for six years to come might easily be as bad as anything known hitherto. As for the apportionment of the Regents among the Judicial districts of the State, though its natural tendency would be to increase rather than diminish the danger of p litical interference in their selection, still. It is manifestly desirable on some accounts that the board should fairly represent the various parts of the commonwealth. For obvious reasons. Tbe Tribune Is reluctant to find fault with a plan of school administra tion which contains a promise of unification under a competent directing body aud of permanent relief from the distracting con troversy which it has earnestly endeavored to help compose in the only rational manner. We gladly acknowledge the good features of this latest measure, but we know that it ought to be dealt with deliberately, and our impres sion is that it may need to be amended in some particulars. .A.V IXSPIRIXO EXAMPLE. By the elow removal of dead bodies from the Harwick mine the public is etill forced to con template the tragedy enacted there early In the week. There is one phase of the unfortu nate business, though, on which the mind can dwell with pleasure and protit. Even yet, per haps, enough attention has not been directed thereto. In the beautiful heroism of those wbo bought to rescue the Imprisoned miners there is inspiration for the dullest soul. No one knew better than McCann. Taylor, Lysle and their associates the risks they ran. They were only too familiar with tbe consequences of past explosions. Afterdamp unquestionably meant more to them than to mos people, but they dreaded Its effects upon others rather than upon themselves. Tbe one thought which occupied their minds was the desolation with which nearly two hundred homes were threat ened. In an attempt to reduce this to the lowest possible minimum they were willing to imperil, and even sacrifice, their lives. Tbe world cannot honor such a spirit too much. If it had been practicable to witness what happened Inside the mine immediately after the explosion. It is pomtble that one might have been privileged to look upon equally noble, if ab-lutely futile, efforts. Though It Is an established fact that about one-half of the colliery disasters on record are the result of tbe carelessness of the miners, it Is also true that this weakness is characteristic of only a few, not of the many. It is known that a con rideraole proportion cf the men employed In coal mine, especially of those of American Mrth. show nm-h consideration for their fel lows and assistants. Roberts. In his book on the anthracite industry, furnishes numerous Illustrations of that iralt. Tlmo and time again '' who have tinrveK txvn hurt will i-uuse in their own flisht to help others v.h. hav- been paralyzed by fear. How larre pjqnattltNu ci xht, minx xeUo wer at wort ' NEW-YOKK DAlr-L TiBTySK FRIDAY. JANtJABY 20. 1004 in the Harwick mine were killed instantly anil how many remained conscious for an hour or more nobody cau tell. It is not at all im probable, though, that the Kfenes described by Huberts were repeated or paralleled on this occasion. Humanity nnd courage are widely distributed In all trades and professions. They animate tbe millionaire engineer and the humbt workman. A LESSOX ON IRRESPOXSIBILITY. We hope that District Attorney Jerome will not fail to notice the account of tbe remark of Patrolman Datton before Magistrate Ommea when he was reprimanded for clubbing a pris oner Didn't Jerome siy out In Chicago that we were to Ix-at our iidsouers It ought to luipre6a on Mr. Jerome miud the evil of reck less and Irresponsible utterance, especially on the part of n man in official position. We have nevrr sopposed tor a moment that Mr. Jerome rcnlly meant to advocate carnival of bead breaking on the part of the police either in New-York or Chicago, aud we advised our Chicago friends not to miud, when they got excited about his Incitement of their peace orticcrs to violence. We told them it was jnst a way Mr. Jerome had of overstating himself. Nevertheless, if Mr. Jerome's remarks had any effect at all, it wad Inevitable that they should be In the direction of lawlessness, and It is now apparent that they did have that effect. One swallow does not make a summer, and the excuse of one putrolnian is not to be taken as evidence that the whole force is going to jro clubbing In conscious accord with Mr. Jerome's advice. Dalton's remark, however, indicates that the District Attorney's words have been taken account of by the police. They mny not, tbey probably do not, prompt delib erate brutality, but tlipy come to mind as a ready excuse for brutality Indulged in under some other provocation. To that extent they nre demoralizing. They weaken self-control. They also tend to diminish the respect which policemen should entertain for the District Attorney as a representative of the dignity and sanctity of law. It must be distinctly humiliat ing to him and unfortunate for tbe community thiit his -considered talk should come as current coin of excuse to a polleeman rebuked for brutal and disorderly conduct It would have been natural In Devery's time to expect n pntrolman to quote the bip chief as an authority for some outrageous conduct, but we hnrdly expect Mr. Jerome's table talk to serve goca purposes. BRIDGE STAGES. An enterprising person with some scrawny nags on their way to the boneyard baa attempt ed to start an omnibus Hue across the Will iamsburg Bridge. He did not secure liberal patronftfji because possible patrons were de terred by the humane fear of adding to the bttrden of his steeds, and after a few trips the police put I stop to liis activities oing to his lack of a license. Thus this attempt to aeoin modate the public came to a timely end. It failed because It was founded on no proper preparation to meet the reasonable demands of the situation. There Is, however, no good reason why the WlHiamsburc Kridpe should uot be made Immediately useful by a decently equipped stase line. There nre plenty f berata In the city, fully ah to drag an om nibus over the bridge at good speed, with ea for thm themselves nnd with comfort for their passengers. Why Fliould the work be loft to somebody with only scarecrows for motive power It Is not to be supposed for an Instant that the authorities would refuse permission tor the running of proierly equipped stages over the brldjre If a license were sought from them on reasonable terms by trustworthy pers us Some of the automobile rnmnantaa which nre trying to popularize heavy vehicles like truck and stapes might find It profitable to demon strata the capabilities of their inventions by running them on the bridge. If there wero room enough after the cars were running, it might not be a bad thing to have such a line permanently, perhaps allowing Its managers to charge 10 cents fare for extra accommoda tions. That would enable women compelled to cross the bridge at tbe rush hour to enrnpe un pleasant crowding. Temporarily, at any rate, a line of automobiles would be useful, and ought to be profitable, particularly as the ve hicles could probably be used for other pur poses afterward. JAP AXD RVSB. Comparisons, or contrasts, between Japan and Itusslii are striking, in more than one re epect. Thus Japau has about 47..0U0 people and Russia perhaps 130,.. Again. Japan's land area Is scarcely 13. square miles, while Russia's Is nearly 8,700,. 8o Russia has nearly three times as many people and more than fifty times as much hind as Japan. Wherefore, we might think. Russia might well afford to bo a little less land hungry at Japan's expense. On the other hand, Japnn, with her so much smaller population, has more pupils in her schools than Russia. According to the latest available statistics, Japan has 4.302.G23 chil dren in elementary schools, and Russia only 4.103.594. That Is to say, ninety-one in every thousand Japanese and only thirty-two in every thousand Russians are in elementary schools. The disproportion of numbers in sec ondary schools and universities Is equally marked, In favor of Japan. Again. Japan has 4.80 postofflces. or one to every 9,700 people, while Russia has only 6.029, or one to every 21.500 people. Japan has. under sail and steam, a commercial marine of 734,413 tons, while Russia has only 633.822 tons. Japan's purchases from the United States amount to about 21,, a year, and Rus sia's to only 17,,. Of course. It Is argued that Russia is still in an elemeutary 6ta of development. Rut Russia lias been in full and direct Intercourse with the civilized world 6lnce the time of Peter the Great, two hundred years ago. while Japan has been in a similar state scarcely fifty years. That is to say, Japan has made three times the progress Russia has. and In one-fourth the time. In such circumstances, It Is not at all strange that the admiration and sympathy of the world are given to Japan in a great measure. PISTOLS IN POCKETS. In the trial of Callohan in the Court of Gen era Sessions before Judge McMahon, upon a charge of killing Irving, both men having been members of East Side trr.opa of ruffians, a great deal of testimony was taken as to the carryin of deadly weapons by lawbreakers. It is evidently time that stern repressive meas ures be adopted against carrying pistols in the pocket How much shooting In the streets is there in London or other European cities There in too much of it among the murderous gangs in the moat degraded districts of New- York. Bearing concealed weapons, naanyl uy der due warrant of law or ordinance or permit. as In the eases of policemen, detectives and watchmen and guardians of property generally, ought to be punished with such rigor that the practice will be broken up. It lead pettation of an appalling nunil r- of f.-1.-ules. Compared with the output of hard and soft coal the year befure. that of 1003 in tbe United Ftates shows a gain of about forty million tons. Owing to th striks of tha anthracite miners In 1902. only a trifling increase was then made over the production of 190L All de ficiencies are now made up. however. Consider ing the severity of the present winter, this Is a pleasant fact to contemplate. Cuba has had another fatal election riot. Peaceful methods of self-government re some times long In taking root Our Senate at Albany has adopted a resolu tion approving the bil In Congrress for the pen sioning of members of lifesaving crews. These brave fellows get small pay. They frequently suffer the worst of hardships and risk their lives In heroic rescues. They are entitled to pensions granted with proper safeguards and conditions. It hardly seems possible that an overhead trolley will be set up In West-st.. In opposition to overwhelming public sentiment or that trans fers will be refused at various crossings, in de flence of constituted authority and the decisions of the courts. Nevertheless, It should be kept in mind that the practice of ordering pas sengers to take the car ahead Is still kept up, and that the ordinance forbidding that abuse is not enforced. Bogota Isn't Panama, May It not be possible that the St Louis police force will be sadly overtaxed with a World's Fair and a National Democratic Con vention on Its hands at the same time in the month of July Governor Murphy's recent protest sgalnst th- monstrosities of advertising along the railroad lines In New-Jersey was sound and timely. In Paris and some other European cities property owners sre not permitted to affront tbe vision with hideous displays of any kind. Liberty Is not permitted to degenerate Into offenslvs license In such matters. Governor Murphy's example might well be followed in other States. Why cannot that gloomle.t -f pessimists, th Nebraska hypochondriac, swallow a few do9 of liquid sunshine. although the Democratic party Is doomed to defeat In November The world Is not wholly out of Joint and all awry, notwithstanding that the Iron dice of destiny have been thrown, and It Is plain beyond dis pute that Mr. Bryan cannot be the candidate this year or control the national convention of this year. TUB TALK OF THE DAT. A new graft has been discovered In Sedalla. ssys one of the papers at that place. Every night for some tlm past the men's waiting room at the Missouri Pacific station has been crowds with men sleeping In the seats. When asked their business there by station attendants, they invari ably resurrected tickets to dome nearby town and said that they were waiting for trains. A few days ago about fifty of these regular boarders ap plied nt the ticket office to have the tickets re deemed. The agent then became aware of ths fact that the tickets were purchased for the sols pur pose of bunking In a warm room. A Way Out. Wife Dirng, we- dined at the Sciuatsons just one week apo to-night.

Speaker Cannon en terd his private office the other morning much preoccupied. NeaL the colored messet.gei of a succession of Speakers, noticed there was some thing U king In Mr. Cannon's attire. The crttval was missing. In fact, the Speaker had come all the way from his rH'ltncf to ti- Capitol without one. lie waa worried by the discovery. Jtint a few momenta he fore he hud come from the barber shop, where he haJ mi-ic another discovery . which he has not jret bt n he to fully explain.

I thought I had Jut removed that collar. said he. and he went to the hook on the wall ard satla tlrj Mb old Sjres tit he had. There was the par ticular pit re of linen suspended. But he could not dlnpute there was another collar still around his neck and he removed It to the same hook upon the nail. Mr. Cannon had com to the Capitol wearing two collars but no cravat. How he got them on the Speaker does not know, hut It was done some how In a lit of abstraction. Washington Post. Private John Allen, according to a Washington paper, tells of an amusing conversation between two old colored women that he overheard on a Washington streetcar.

REYES REFUSED AGAIN. Hay Once More Declines to Reopen Panama Question. Washington. Jan. 10. Secretary Hay yester day sent another communication to General Ilafael Reyes, the Colombian Envoy, in response to his protest against the action of the United States regarding affairs on the Isthmus of Pan ama. While State Department officials decline to make any specific statement as to its nature. It is understood that, In a general way, it fol lows the lines laid down In the reply to Oeneral Rwyes's first note, which practically declined to reopen the Panama question, and also follows tho recent message of the President to Congress on the Panama question. Justifying the step taken by the United States government. The reply does not discuss one matter which General Reyes urged In his second note, the transmission to the Senate of the correspondence between himself and the State Department. It is known that the officials of the State Depart ment resented the suggestion of General Reyes as highly improper, and for this reason the an swer does not discuss this request. The matter of sending the correspondence with General Reyes to the Senate has not yet been deter mined by the President. The Bunding of the note to General Reyes yes terday prevented his contemplated trip to Bal timore for treatment by a specialist, for which he had made arrangements the day before. Gen eral Reyes's last note also contained soma ref erence to the submission of disputed points to arbitration, but State Department officials say that there is nothing in the present situation for The Hague tribunal, if any reference to that court were Intended. General Reyes la ready to leave the city at any time for Colombia, where his personal and political Interests require his attention. It was said to-night that he might leave this country within the next ten days, but no information waa obtainable from him, as he declined to see reporters, on the plea that he was very busy. From the standpoint of the State Department, there is no reason why he should hasten his departure, as he might very well remain and render considerable service to his country. Tha suggestion was made to-night that possibly he might stay and try to open diplomatic relations with Panama, through its representative here, for the adjustment of such questions as the as sumption by Panama of a part of the exterior debt of Colombia. Some suggestion also has been made, though not officially, of a reunion of the two govern ments under the name of the Republic of Co lombia, Panama to have an autonomous gov ernment, with absolute authority to deal with all questions relating- to the control of canal matters. COLOMBIAN THOOPS OFF NICARAGUA. Three Hundred Land on St. Andrew's Island To Put Down Rebellion, It Is Said.

This island is off the coast of Nicaragua, but is a de pendency of Colombia. Admiral Coghlan says that thin information confirms that which he had previously in regard to the landing of these troops. It is believed that thf troops were those which eft the mouth of the Atrata Uiver feme time ago. bound north. It is believed that they wpnt to 8t- Andrews Island to put down a secession movement which it was announced had as sumed some shape there. BRITISH PARTY LEADERS BITTER. Exchange of Notes Between Mr. Chamber lain and the Duke of Devonshire. London, Jan. 11. An acrimonious correspond enca between the Duke of Devonshire and Jo seph Chamberlain is published this morning The duke, who is president of the Liberul- L'nlonlst Association, formed at the time the Liberal party split on tha home rule qoesttoo, wrote to Mr. ChambcrUin suggesting that the association should dissolve, owlaf to the diffi culty of allocating the funds now that the party had become divided by the fiscal contro versy. Mr. Chamberlain in a long rejoinder saM he thought it best to let pimping dogs li. but that if the Duke of Devonshire wanted to make a fiscal test question b had bst take a vote of the members of the association and let Um defeated lf.rty retire. The duke replied objecting to such a violent disruption of the association, and asking for a friendly discussion of the arrangements for dis solution. Mr. Chamberlain closes the correspondence by announcing that as the duke will not accept his views he is determined to tall a meeting on his own responsibility, nnd that the course to be pursued will be decided at this meeting.

The reassuring news that the Russian warships which recently left Vladi vostock have returned there Is confirmed in a Vladivostock dispatch received at St. Peters burg. The dispatch asserts, however, that only th armored cruiser Gromovol went to sea for a couple of days' practice, the other ships of the fleet having remained at Vladivostock. Special dispatches from Tokio printed in this morning's newspapers are very warlike, but add little or nothing to the knowledge of the situation. They reiterate that Japan has no idea of sending an ultimatum to Russia, Anxiety is apparently felt ln Tokio for the safety of the cruisers Niasln and Kasaga, which left Genoa on Saturday, and In connection with the departure of which the Genoa correspondent of The Dally Mall this morning gives a curi ous story to tha effect that an iron bar waa found Inside the ammunition hold of the Nlaaln, placed ln such a position that It short circuited the electrical apparatus with. It Is suggested, the object of destroying the vessel, although there is no evidenc to show that its being there was not accidental No serious damage was done. Seoul dispatches report the arrival of addi tional Russian and Italian marines there. The Dally Mall's Tokio correspondent as serts that the negotiations between Russia and Japan have passed beyond diplomacy, and state that some Corean officials have appealed to tha American Legation at Seoul for protection, but thnt Minister Allen upbraided them for think- Ing of their personal safety at such a time. A severe gale ln the Mediterranean Is greatly incommoding the Russian warships. The cruia ers Nicholas I and Nicholas II entered Ferrol for safety, and two Russian battleships and seven torpedo bot destroyers have been de tained at Puda Bay since Friday, unable to pro ceed to the Far East on account of tha weather. Lord Ronaldshay, who returned to England recently from Manchuria and Japan, confirm reports that Russian troops are posted every five versts along the lino of tha Manchurlan Rail way. The Russians, however, recognise that the chief danger Is ln a breakdown of the rail way, owing to Us slight construction, under tha pressure of the enormous military trafflo. HASTENING BACK TO JAPAN. Japanese Army Officers Recalled from Eng land and Berlin. Colonel I. Oka ar.d Major I. Fururrd. of tha Japanese Army, are here on their way to Japan. They will sail from San Francisco on the Coptic next Thursday, if they can reach the Golden Gate ln time. Colonel Oka has been in England for five months, where he went to watch the British Army manoeuvres, and since has been studying British military tactics. He has made a close study of the British Army, Us equip ment and methods, nnd says that, while Britain has a few modern appliances which his army lacks. Japan will supply herself with all of them which are really effective in case of uar. Ha says that his country recognizes that, war or no war. she must keep up with the times ln matters of naval and military armament and equipment. Major Kuruml, who waa military attache at Berlin, waa recalled because of the war outlook- He does not believe that war will le declared, but as It is policy Yor his country to b prepared for whatever happens, all at taches and others who are abroad have been or dered to hold themselves In readiness to return at a moment's notice, and many have been re called. A3IERICANS OFFER TO SERVE. Many Applications at Japanese Consulate Why They Are Refused. Many applications have been made to Sada zuchl Uchlda, Japanese Consul Oeneral in this city, for commissions In the army and navy of Japan by Americans. Matiy of those who have offered their services are former United States army and navy officers and privates who have been In actual warfare in Cuba and the Philip pines. So numerous, ln . have become the offers both ln person and by letter th.t the consul general said yesterday he was consider ing the advisability of having his unvarying answer to these men printed, aa it would save much time. Mr. LVhida said Of course, we greatly appreciate the kindly sentiment expressed by those who wish to fight ln our army, but there Is no volunteer army ln Japan, and all the aoldlera are Japanese so I am compelled to decline their services with the expression of our deep gratitude. There are also ln this city many officers and private soldiers of the Japanese army reserves who have evinced their anxiety to go home and help conquer the enemy. Thus far no order has come for their return, but they hold them selves in readiness for a hurry call, which will c.e through Consul General Uchlda only In the event of war being declared. Speaking yes terday of the situation, the consul general said Modern warfare, even to the victorious nation, is a costly undertaking, both in point of human lles uarriticed and of money expended. But Jan is well prepared for any emergency, though she Is not provoking a war. This affair is a result of the Chino-Japanese War. and our statesmen have foreseen tt. My country Is fully equipped for it. The Sun Trade Journal. a well Informed Tokio monthly, representing the commercial In terests of Japan, says edltorlallv In its Decem ber number, under the heading Preparations for War. in part This quiet attitude on the part of the Japanpe povernment can only be explained in either of these two ways, viz. Either Japan means to set tle the Manchurlan question peacefully with Russia or that her preparations, both mlltary and naval, are so complete that she need not trouble herself.

Xot Hostile to This Country in the Far East. Washington. Jan. 10. An authority c-nversant with Russia's position In the Far East, and her attitude toward American interests, made to-day the following statement In view of the wide circulation given reports without basis In fact, chargins Russia with hos tility to American Interests in the Far East, it seems expedient that the attitude of Russia should be again defined. Russia has repeatedly expressed her Intention of assisting tha development of commercial Inter ests In Manchuria, knowing that the Chinese policy of the United States government Is guided merely by an aim to djvelop tride and not by political ambition. Russia has shown her good faith by refraining from any action which would en danger the eonclu3lon of the American-Chinese commercial treaty signed on October S. That treaty has been ratified by the throne at F and thus, through the medium of tha United States, the important ports of Moukden and Antung. in Manchuria, are opened to the commerce of the world. This is the 'open door which ha been a part of American and Russian policy since the Boxer outrages, which necessitated the Interven tion of the powers, and which materially changed conditions in Manchuria. Russia will certainly not submit to dictaaon at the hands of any power as to the protection of her legitimate Interest in Manchuria. Negotiations ara In progress between St. Petersburg and Peking Ln the effort to reach an agreement adequately pro tecting the special or predominant Inrtuence exer cised by Russia in Manchuria, and which has been recognized by all the powers signatory to the peace protocol verbally or In writing. At tha time ci the signing of that convention It waa Russia's hope that she could with safety with draw her forces from Manchuria last October, and leave the protection ut her interests to China, In 'ho nit time, however, it. was clearly demon strated that the guarantees offered by China were wholly Insufficient, and it became necessary for tr.e Russian government to ask for additional guar antees. Until these have been arranged for tha Russian goernment cannot be expected to with draw from Manchuria, and thus menace the many Russian livea and forfeit the 2.50,A which haa 1.-een spent there in the civilization and development of that province. Russia Is ready and anxious to stimulate the de velopment of foreign commerce in Manchuria. The growth of trade means the success of the Siberian railway. Russia believes, however, that this com mercial development is possiole without the estab lishment of spheres of political influence irx ih open ports. Russia's political influence in this ter ritory, which lies in her borders, is and must 04 considered predominant, and its effectiveness would be lmpairea by the creation of any form of foreign political Influence in the shape of extra-territorial government or municipal control and regulation of certain districts within thaae open ports similar to conditions such as. for example, exist at Shanghai. But no trouble Is anticipated on this score, aj th American-Chinese commercial .treaty, providing for the setting aside of certain districts in Moukcien and Antung -b places of international residence and trade, and the provision for their regulation, is not considered aa tending toward the establishment of a system like that surrounding foreign interests at Shanghai. 'Russia does not propo3 to discuss tha negotia tions now ln progress. B'lt It should be realized that she Is availing herself of very reajonabie means to reach an agreement by diplomacy. It will be an Interesting bit of Information to the Russian government to know that tha primary ol- Ject of the Tokio negot'ations. so far as Japan is corcernpd. Is the protection of American ard Ens- Ush Interests ln the Far East. Russia had supposed that Japan was influenced by less unselfish mo tives. EDUCATION, JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY. These, Dr. Adler Says. Will Solve the Nego Problem, Dr. Felix Adler addressed the New-York Society for Ethical Cultura yesterday. In Carnegie Hall, n 'The Negro Problem In th United Stat-s. He aid in part There has ben prorress In the South, and the prominence given to the negro problem Is the out come of some rt the progress of tha South. The condition to-dav In the South Is simtlar to that which existed during the latter part of the Middle Ages In Europe, and whch resulted In the French Revolution. In old ante-bellum days there were only two classes In our South the wealthy whites and the poor whltev To-day there has risen a prosperous and working middle class, which is coming Into iower and It Is becausa the white men who are worklr.s are beginning to want a plac and distinction pointed out for themselv which hall dtinfulh them from the Inferiors. It Is a case of climbing up by pushing some one else back. What are th meanire In which we may trust to ameliorate present conditions First, education Is our one great hopeful method. Second, exact and equltahe administration of Justice. Treat tha negro as a grown man. Th te-m child race la iwniraui term to use. Undue severity fan j. tendency to distort the moral fibre, and undue lnincy creates a laxity of moral fibre. Third, a hher conception of democracy the most Im portaal of all. the including o' the negro in tha am demccracy with the white man. Trua dmocr.icy la a compact between the efficient and th- less efficient, the nrfllclent and the lass In efMdent for the help of the weaker. But, if th constitutional amendments which ar oeins Inaugurated In the South are to be used per marently for the dtsenfranchisement of the negro, there Is boind to be a deplorable retrogression. If. on the other hand, they are to be ued as a means of educating the negro up to the prln of be lrsj vested with the responsibilities of citizenship, we cannot tell how great a future the South has. lai u Northerners not assume airs of superiority over the South, neither let us hector nor lecture her rather .let us take hold with brotherly Interest and help aM we may.

Declares Constitution Did Not Warrant In terference in Coal Strike. In a debate yesterday before the New-Rochelle People's Forum, Martin W. Littleton. Borough President of Brooklyn, attacked the rocy of President Roosevelt in Interfering In tha coal strike of 1302. He said that while tha President's inter vention between the employers and the mlnera un doubtedly averted great suffsrlng at the time, still his action in thrustlr-s the govet ment between the employer and employed without constitutional warrant established a precedent the evil effects of which would remain aa lon as the government lasted. Mr. Littleton added that he would con demn any President who Interfered In the con duct of private business, no matter which polltic.i party he represented. The power of the State government of Pennsylvania or any of th States. Mr. Littleton declared, was strong enough to stop any insurrection within its borders without calling on the National Executl The debato was on Strikes Are They a Social Benefit Herbert N. Casson took the part of the strikers. Mr. Littleton said that he recognized the right of all workmen to strike when the corditior.3 Imposed on them by their employes didn't suit them, nevertheless. In his opinion, few strikes were of benetlt to any one. What remedy do you suggest to prevent strikes demanded a Union man in the audience. I can't tell. replied Mr. Littleton. If I could I would be v.-orth more to the people of tho United States than most of the lawyers and doctora com bined. It strikes int. however, that the enforce ment of the law is one of the best remedies fjsj have. I would make the corporations live up to the laws and working men overywnere respect the rights of property a.ud of other mtn not members of thtir unions to work. I would siK3t a charge In Um charters of corporatlona. They should be chartered by the courts and not by the executive. On Sunday. J.tnuary 21. Edward M.

An inventory of her injuries later by Dr. Maira, the ship's surgeon, developed that beyond many bruiser her only hurt was a discolored eye and a lump on her forehead. Temporary wooden ladders were rigged np the comparilonway for the use of the officers for the rest of the voyage. The gaping wound in ths ship's side was patched up with tarpau lin, but for the rest of the voyage th stearar had to alow down whenever she met roug'a weather, which was most all the time, for fear of taking heavy waves aboard.

Their party, as a wttole, may be strengthened by the abolition of patronage and a By stem which subjects the claims of both parties to unbaub-t popular Jadfaccnt But they themselves in Washington foe it necessary to ksp their pern a 1 hold on lorJ politicians by distrfbcilns favors. Ac cord3iy they never fail to show their bitter ness toward th CMI Service law, but tho hist thin they intend to do is abolish It. Not one of them on either aide wishes his party to go into odsslqs niapaign wlUi tbe record of having cenepleoaiy oreftanied the merit sys tem, htwever much he may dislike It and bo willing to get amend It when ho can. At this late das it is scarcely necessary to the assail attacks of the Kpcilsaa. They reiterate the same eld. long exploded ar- CUDtHt3. Still, it mny bo rerth while te note th liat which the rttal invatijratlon throws upon taelr pet theory tluit Oestrressmen can i-cconecirad as yeod gevsrnnent einplires as any Civil Service CoaMf.Meira can pick out by OMBtniaftess.

And In turn politicians expect to use offices which thfy batow nx a t . for poHtlcal wstk, thus turning the ma cfclacry which the ppojjie establish for their own serr Into B9 iustraracct for the people eootx-J. That Is not democracy. That is the system which prevailed In England under Georsre and corrupted government from top to bottom. The merit system as administered has defects. There art incompetent clerks In ollice. It will be Interesting to observe, however, where the Congressmen who complain over the cost of the departments on this account will stand when efforts are made to reduce by a half hour the already moderate day's work In tho executive oGlcs. One of the principal causes of ineffi ciency is the Congressional habit of getting around the merit system. A temporary service Is orgudaM by favoritism, and then its clerics are covered Into the classified, with all of the protection of the merit system, without having undergone the sifting process which makes those who have won in competition worth pro tecting. After doing all they can to debauch the system and prevent its giving the public go d service, it ill becomes the spoilsmen to Indulge In virtuous laments over the sufferings of the country from the Civil Service law. A FOOLISH SCHEME. It is reported that the Assistant Counsel to the Corporation has personally delivered Into safekeeping at Albany a bill which provides for, or permits, the city to Issue ten year bonds wherewith to pay for practically unlimited re pairs to the County Courthouse. The fact that Mr. Guy Is arranging for the introduction of tin iimwiui justices a belief that the admin istration wants to have it passcil and makes a word of warning necessary. Tbcie have been various plans for reconstructing the courthouse at groat expense, and one or two of them have been strongly enough supported to cause some anxiety, but they have not commanded public favor. The must ambitious of these schemes was that propo d by some of the Judges, which called for an outlay of about 2,0X,, and yet was officially acknowledged to be In many respects n tiifftnrr If Mr. Guy's bill should be ptsnd it is not unlikely that an even larger sum would bo demanded. Wo are persuaded that all such ambitious projects nre unwise for two reasons. In the first place, the courthouse is not worth a heavy expenditure. In tho sec ond , if the proposition is virtually to make a new buiUlin of it, though the plans and the Wkmaashlp mi-lit be intrinsically ex cellent, the site would still be unsuitable and the result disappointing. President Ahearn of the Borough of Manhat tan took occasion shortly before he succeeded Mr. Cantor to NMff the proposal that such pcbll- buildings a3 the city urgently needs, in curting a new eonrthocse, should be put up between the Hall of Records and Broadway. Xo such lnrgo plan can be carried out rapidly, but Mr. A hear n Is right in declaring that the city should determine to make an extensive improvement of that nature and do the work gradually as circumstances permit. The first esEPtial 6tp is to take possession of the land. Hi tir opinion, frequently expressed, is that it is foolish to postpone its acquisition. The value of the property will certainly never be less than it is now, and there is every reason to believe That It will steadily Increase. The buildings standing there could bo temporarily used to a greater extent than they now are for the transaction of public business, and from the first ha investment would probably prove avnntageous. Tnerp Is ranch evidence that these views are generally shared by intelligent citizens, as they are knewn to be by members of the present and former administrations, and for this reason Mr. Guy's bill is not likely to find smooth sail ing. Te are convinced that It ought to n ceunter fatal opposition. Undoubtedly, the courthouse is inconvenient and unsanitary. It exposes Juflsros. Juries, lawyers, litigants, wit nesses and attendants to manifold discomforts and dangers, and there Is no reafon to hope that progress with the plan propped by Mr. Ahearn will 'ne rapid enough to obviate the need of Incurring a considerable bill for repairs. But reconstruction on an elaborate scale at enor mous cost would be a blunder. JAPAyS VIEW OP RUSSIA. In making what is said to be a pacific, or nt least non-bttgercnt, reply to Russia's latest note concerning the Mandturian-Corean ques tion, Japan has. from the Jupanesa print of view, acred with much moderation and re straint. For to the .Tapcaeso nrtud the Ruiun proposals were so offensive as to eavor of add ing insult to injnrv. Tints nil talk aboirt Rus clan eonetssioni to Japan in Corea, If not In Manchuria, is regarded by the Japanese as es sentially ttcrtertrnL They boW that, accord ing to every valid aril topical principle, the nat ural rights of Japan there are far superior to any Russia mr.y p 3 - Japan wad fighting wnrs with Kubiai Khan over Corea at a time wlieu tb cLiaf tains of what has since bean do veloped Into Russia were making pilgrimages into Asia to kiss a Tarter tyraiu s stirrup in token of subjection to him. In proximity, In magnitude of Interests, and In all considerable ret-pect, Japan o far outranks Russia that tho concessions and condescension, if any there shall be, must be rtHI by Japan to Russia, and not by Russia to Japan. Japan therefore strongly resents the Russian prescriptions that Japan must not do thus and so in Northern Corea. She holds that no potrer in the world has a right thus to dictate t her. This is tke inre co f-ince Russia at the mine time declares tmat she accepts bo cosMUtirns In reference to Manchuria. Why not, asks Japan, since she assumes so high and mighty a t concerning Japan In Corea Why most Japan in Oorea suffer conditions which Russia will net toWrara in Manchuria Surely, they say, Jpaa's rights in Corea are far su perior to Russia's in Maaciruria. Children in their play have a Keying intended to denote mcncpcJlstic greed. It is What's yours la Mine, and wliat's mine Is ray own. That, in the Japanese viow, is Russia's attitude. She claims as exclusively her own Manchuria, re fnsing even to discnis its disposal and at the same time sac claims the control of Corea, which properly bonj within Japan's sphere of infinencts. In brief, think the Japanese, Rus sia arrogates to brsoif monopolistic authority la tUat part of the world. She insists that she nisy do as ait pIeMM without consul tlag any one else, bet tlmt nobody else shall do anything without censnltingr her. Whether iitk Japanese view of the Russian srovenuaotK ad it daigTii bo true or false. it soeeis to have same justifltfttira in th uttcr aiyaos of the Russia press v birb arc approved by the Bvsaiaa official renat. Thus tha Briot, f St. Pntersbnrg, which reseats The Tribune' a sanction of reference of the whole matt' to ITir i.i'.-.f. deelaroa that th opaniag of Man f-htirian ports to Ainorican coinercf, under the American treaty with China, without the con tent of Russia, is an open prm - ocaton of Rus sia. Since waeo, it might l asked, has it been ory for America to get Russia's consent to the tanking of a treaty with another sov ereign pwer But what a discrepancy there is between that and the other llussiau Etntement, that we cannot discuss Manchuria any more than we could Australia or the Philippines. Manchuria does not belong to us.

ELECTRICITY ON THE CENTRAL. Criticism which was elicited by one feature of the electrical programme of the New- York Central Uaiiroad has just received attention from two well known technical periodicals, The Electrical World and Engineer and The Engineering Kecord. Up to tho present time lu-actlailiy all the electric traction work dono m tho world has beea performed with a direct current. A number of experiments have been coodnctod with the alternating current of late. Some of these encourage the hop that this typo of current mny eventually prove serviceable, but it can hardly be siid that all of the minor questions Incident to its adoption have yet beon solved. Under tlie circumstances, tfce Central gave the preference to the direct current, ami now one occasionally hears the suggestion that when its motors are in actual use they will be obsolete. For their approval of the Central's choice tho technical Journals present two cogent reasons. In view of the immense amount of traffic to be handled and the vast Inconvenience which would result from a serious interruption, it Is better to eliminate all doubt and uncertainty at the outset Again, certain other railways notably that In the subway which the Central will make connections have decided to use the direct current. It is desirable, of course, to have the roiling stock so equipped that trains from one road ran be run over the tracks of the other and unnecessary changes of car by pMMBgon averted. To the general public these considerations will appeal so strongly that it Is safe to say that tho Central's decision will ex cite almost unanimous commendation. The pa trons of the road will unquestionably be better pleased to see a well tried system adopted soon than to be obliged to wait several years longer for the promised Innovation. It Is due to tho Central to remember that It has already displayed a distinctly progressive 6plrlt in 6evpral ways. The company Is a pio neer in the substitution of electricity for steam on a large scale In this country. For Its power stations It has ordered engines of the most modern type the steam turbine. The electric locomotives which are to haul Info the city Its great express trains will likewise represent the hitest advances In mechanism which hare stool the test of actual service. Besides, If the time ever comes when the Central deems it expedient to Introduce the alternating current, no orml daWe barrier to the change will exist. No Im portant modification will be necessary In the powr stations. Its dynamos would generate an alternating current anyhow, and the con version of this Into a diroet current would then be discontinued. As for the motors both tho mounted on the trucks of the suburban cars and those employed to draw through trains they could probably be sold without grest loss. Th future, therefore, can be left to take care of itsolf. The present Is of Infinitely greater Im portance. SYMPATHY FOR A DRUyKARD. It wa anything but typical, stern Jersey Jufith'e when a Jury in New-Hrunswlck fined a ririsonor 100 for Inflicting a fatal Injury with a billiard cue In a drunken brawl with a mnn wttla whom bo had been friendly in his sober momenta. It is true the criminal had no Intention of taking the life of his friend. He was so com pletely Intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing. Hut the courts have usually ruled that a man must be held responsible for serious offences against the laws, even when committed under the influence of alcohol. The tine in this en mi a grotesquely insuffi cient penalty fur this homicide. Surely a long term of Imprisonment should have been Im posed, although there was no premeditated and malicious scheme to do mortal harm. Severn lessons In such cases may accomplish good re sults. Maudlin compassion for drunkards who are guilty of crimes while their faculties are befuddled is sorely out of place. ATEItTISO FOREST FIRES. A valuable report on the suppression and pre rratloii of forest fires has jnst been made a li able by publication In pamphlet form. The paper results from action taken last June, after extensive destruction had occurred In tho Adl rnndacks, by the Board of Trade of this city. That organization Instructed Its committee on forests to Investigate tho subject with special retcrenco to New-York State's own preserves, and the duty has been performed in an admi rable manner. No one who read's the document can fail to be Impressed with the clearness, breadth and force with which the matter is handled. In most cases tho only damage done by forest fires Is to the timber itself. Even this amounted to about 3,, In the Adirondack last May, to lay nothing of an expenditure of no, for fighting the flames. A less frequent but more lamentable consequence of these outbreaks Is a loss of life. Five hundred persons perished nt Illnckley, Minn., In 1804 in this way, and about one thousand In Wisconsin In IS7L The fires in New-York State last spring had no such tragic accompaniment, but there are possibili ties which houll not be Ignored. Many thou sand summer visitors go there and to the Cats kills every year. From the North Woods, In particular, the avenues of escape are few, long and tortuous. Had the great conflagration of 1003 occurred throe months later thwn It did, an unprecedented sacrifice of human life mlht have resulted. Still another danger one which has boen less distinctly foreseen, but which should be guarded against is pointed out In tho report nt mentioned. On many of the Bteeper slopes In the Adlrondacks the burning of the old growth hns not been followed by a new one. An Increasing number of unsightly patches is thereby caused. Let that Influence continue to operate, and the mountains will lose their beauty calamity that would be felt by the whole country, and nt merely by a limited lo cality. Denudation might nlso affect the streams which rise in the Adirondack, and on which industry relio for power. Even the question of water supply for remote cities may be more elsely rein ted to the ocenrranee of forest ares than Is irnorally appreciated. A groat deal has been heard of late about the feasibility of llmltrng the effect of tires In the wood 3 by laving out brond parhn. or rides. which intersect one smythpr nt srritable Intervals like city 6trects. The system Is In vogue in Europe, but is only applicable to comparatively level districts. In p. rotten whose surface is so Irregular as that of the Adirondack, thp Board of Trade com ml deems It impracticable. Anothor drawback to the nrioptlon of that plan is that the Staff's ovrn preserves are riot massed in a single area. wrap of them being almost or qultn snrrotinclvd by the property of Individuals or clubs or corporations. There may be parts fit the coMirtry whore the erapoymnit of such lanes would be Judicious, but topographical con siderations discourage their use in Northern New-York. Nevertheless, the committee is able to make four recommndntlons for the promotion of the object in vVmv, and It expresses the hop thnt these will be n.ncttd Into laws. It would have the State's property policed by fire wardens or raacera In the season when fires may bo antici pated compel all camping parties who enter the preserves to employ guides who have been Hocused, and who would know enough to pro vent fires through carelessness Increase tbe penalty for any destruction that Is traceable to railway locomotives, aud provide for State con trol of water' power and water supply. Con cerning the wisdom of the first three of these propositions there will be little dispute. A measure that embodies them should certainly receive favorable consideration at Albany this winter. As to the fourth, ft may be prudent to Isolate it from the others temporarily. Xo doubt such an enactment would assist in preserving the beauty of one of tho mosr famous moun tain jrroups In the world, but it Involves n go.nl mnny other Interests nlso. Tlie committee may be right In protesting agninst giving tho control of the State's water power to nn In dividual or a corporation. Whether the State needs to exercise any new functions itself, though. Is a question which ought not to be de cided hastily. A FORGOTTEN AIOX ARCH'S VIEW OF TT.

PEESIDEXTS POPULARITY The Statesmanlike Acts Thai Should Confute His Critic To the Editor of The Tribun. Sir Your editorial under the caption of TM President and His Critics. In Th Trtbuno ox last Wednesday, was read with considerable interest by the writer. I have noted recently, with a feeling of mild amazement, tntimauona that President Roosevelt la losing his popularity In certain parts of the country that ha a not possibly carry his own State In NoYtracxr that ho la unsafe, because given to Impulsive actions. These criticisms are not conried wholly to those politically opposed to the PreH. dent. But certain Individuals and newspapers of the Republican faith are doing all in tilr power to Increase the perplexity of the average voter respecting the worth of our President. la addition to what I have referred to above they tell us of the part he assumed In the great coal trike. and In the Northern Securities case, dap. recatingly, of course but not a word regard ing ths masterly way he handled the Venezuela problem. To tha mind of many his conduct at that time was proof positive that he coueasa qualities of the highest stateainanap. Ha after the danger point had been passed by ti agreement on the part of the allies to refer tie questions at Issue to the Hague tribunal, there was considerable criticism directed against Ger many for the part that country had taken Ci the affair. In an almost Incredibly short period 0 time the major part of that criticism bad ceased. On looking over certain newspaper clippings of that time I find an item stating that the administration had decided to do all In Its power to check that growing feeling of bitter ness. Wo must admit I was a wise decision, for a great deal of harm can come from tbe un easiness of a great people. For his paQoaoa during the time the allied nations were enforc ing the blockade against Venezuela, and for his farsiehted action after the blockad had been raised, the President should receive duo credit In an Impartial estirnata of his capacity for executive position. As for Mr. Roosevelt's relation to th Northern Securities merger, he would have violated hla oath of office If be na- not taken the action no did. 80 far as I can sea. ha has simply brought that Important case before the Supreme Court for It to decide upon the legality of tbe pro posed consolidation. And again, those who aro free from prejudice may well say that no Presi dent could possibly have assumed a broader minded position In relation to the postal scandal than Mr. Roosevelt has chosen to assume. It I recognized by thoughtful men that dishonesty of public ornctals. If unchecked, will prove 1 most fearful menace to our public institutions Why. things have come to such a pass thai son of our citizens profess to have no faith In the honesty of any man In State or national legis latures. Of course, that Is pessimism run mad. But. on the other band. It Is a straw of some Importance. By the fearless and thorough man ner In which the President has taken hold ef the postal affairs he has performed an act of the greatest Importance to the country. That I another point to the credit of his statesman ship. The wage earners feel that in Mr. Roosevea they have a President who I In sympathy wltA them In their efforts to climb upward. H might listen to the single counsel of ihe great financial Interests If he choe. But he la too great for that. We relieve that he has the Interests of both classes equally at heart. And while the employe class speaks approvingly of the Presi dent, we have also the spectacle of a recent gathering of representative business men en thusiastically Indorsing .him for a renomlnattoa, a striking testimonial of his popularity wlta both classes of men. The srrat basil of business men who conduct their affairs on honest. lawful principles hive no quarrel with the President. On the other hand, one of his strongest claims to our favorable consideration ts the tad that he Is sufficiently alert and brave to block the schemes of a certain class of financiers who have very little consideration for tho welfare or the opinion of the people at large, but ex hibit a great deal of sensitiveness and anxlaty for the success of their own pet plans. I have taken the liberty to write to you staff because I admire President Roosevelt, and see no rmOYi why these who favor him should not be equally outspoken as those who profess to be. opposed to him.

Every j man and woman In that antk nm 1 jrbo was j yelling, cheering, shrieking or blowing a mam moth tin horn was usherins in the Tiger far more than he wns the new year. The iid is oft The lid is off' was the hoarse cry with which men and women greeted each other deliriousiy. Painted women with their peroxide hair marched arm in arm along Broadway, shrieking at the highest pitch of their voice and rtanrlng In derision around every i poUceman they encountered. Men with faces that arc closely identitied with the Tenderloin and the racetrack shoved their way Joyfully through the dense mob, joining with right good wll in the yeiling and furnishing a goodly pro portion of the horn blowing. In their hats these men displayed conspicuously a single playing card, which was a popular and significant badge. The iid is ..ft The lid ia oft was the cry which was tak'n up by thousands of throats and sounded like a triumphal chorus. Every now and again a wild-eyed woman, unable to control her joy any longer, would make a sud den rush and throw her arms hysterically around ihe neck of a passing man. Blond women, blowing horns, were curried on tht Shoulders of yelling men, every human chariot Urns formed escorted by a bodyguard of about a hundred horr.blowing men and women. The sidewalks were unable to hold the dense throng which encroached on the roadway, so that traf fic was for the time being at a standstill. An bum use stuffed tiger, carried on a wagoii and trawn by a pair of big black horses. wa dflfen along Broadway, and became the centr. of a vast elling procession of .n-n and women, who were glad to be able thus to nay summar.. homage to their idol. That the Jubilation wa deeply founded Is plainly to be understood b. those who are in a. position to know the changt that has come over the Tenderloin during the last lew days. All over the Tenderloin gamblers have been secretly planning for weeks to throw opdi their houses as soon as the New Year dawned. A well known Tenderloin sport said last night that within two days four gambling houses wouid be open in Twenty-nlnth-st.. four In Fluty sec and thirteen between Forty secor.d-st. and Forty-rlfth-st. This same man says thai twenty moti proprietors of gambling houses are preparing to open as soon as it is se-n that the first lot are not interfered with. Three new opium dens were said to have been opened last night in Slxth-uve., between Thirty j ninth and Forty-second sts. Disorderly house keepers were preparing to do a flourishing and uninterrupted business. Another Tenderloin habitue told a Tribune reporter that sixteen places of this description were opened last night tan various sections of the Tenderloin. As for the women in the streets, there was not one of them who did not beUeve that with the end of reform rule good tin.es for then were again in sight. Of course we'll have to give up as we did in Urn good old dnys, said one of thtin, but there'll ba a chance to make good money, which there hasnt ben the last two years. Captain Burieiad, ol the Tenderloin station, said There will be no violations of the law while I am in charge here. I am not a politician. I know my dut and shill do it under any circum stances.'' In the Tenderloin it is believed that Captain Burfeind means what he says, but the Tender loin Is also confident that within a few days Burfeind'a transfer will be effected and another and more congenial spirit put n charge of the West Thirtleth-st. station In his stea.l.

Tlic Bishop Examining His Paper Questioning Apostolic Session. The Rev. Dr. Charles A.

Bishop Potter is row considering Dr. Briggs's japer. lie declines to talk about it. So does Dr. 8.-igira, further than to gay that he was miequotea in reports of his address before the Church Club. Asked wherein he was misquoted, It. Brings replied yesterday that he never panted Interviews. He was evidently disturbed by criticisms which were shown to him, but he persisted in his refusal to talic. He admitted that B'Khop Potter had asked for his paper, tut did not know, he said, that the president of Bsc Church Club, whose guest he had been, had entered a protest. In his paper before the club, and in the com ments with which he followed it. Dr. Briggs vwf understood by members of the club to say. ajiMg other things, that apotolo succession hung by a slender historical thread that in por.t of universality the Church of Rome had almost the only claim worth, considering that The Pope of Rome was right, in th main, when lie asserted that Anglican orders were invalid from the Roman point of view. He affirmed the validity of Presbyterian and Lutheran or ders. He was understood to say that he felt humiliation at being compelled .by Bishop Potter to be ordained again when he entered the Epis copal Church, and that the requirement by Bishop Potter and others of reordlnation was an affront to other religious bodies. Dr. Briggs be- Bjrr his paper with the asfertion that he would ay some startling things. Replying. Dr. Fuiton cays When Dr. Brigps entered the Episcopal Church rise leaders of Church opinion resolved that he ho.iid not become a centre of angry controversy, ay he had been in th Presbyterian Church. Per- I haps that is th trouble with him new If Dr. Brjrs imagines thru the -xav to Christian unity lies through tho disloyal y of individuals to the cr.'.irchfi to which thev -severally belong, or In rid- Jeuliric their claim, he is trenndously mistaken. Dr. Kriprs is quito free to hold the validity of PretbyieTiaa nd Lutheran orders. He is equally at lihtry. ridiculour as the thing seems, to strike ,hand v.-Hh the Pcpf of Koine In denying the valid ity of Anglican oraeni. Has not the time come for men of serse la 1 churches to frown down all urh ill tempered and Injurious railing The Living Church. which stoutly opposed the ordination of Professor Briggs by Bishop Totter, called he paper read before the. Church. Club deplorable, and is taken to task by a cor respondent, who declares the incident to be nothing short of a scandal. It would seem that the time has now come, says J. Hall, when the Bishop of New-York should be given plainly to understand that loyal churchmen will refuse to contribute to the building fund of the oaridral on Morningside Heights so long -is ftafeaear Briggs is, even nominally, upon its clergy staff. ie,-F Zabriskle made a short address before the C.'ur. h Club, following Dr. Briggs. in which toe repudiated Dr. Briggs's conclusion, and was 6pr.--i.ed warmly. An Episcopal clergyman of thin diocese, who is close to Bishop Potter, said -f terday hr that a Baptist minister of reptuatinn in liis city its predicting that Prsor Drives will go to the Church of Rome. Utterances in his par before the Church Club furnished new evidenci for such prediction. I beg to say that there l ji'-pty of room outf.ils of th Episcopal Church for tKs v, no hold with rr.'f.-r Drlgss, and In thin livttlon I mould even include the Union Theo li'gictii Sen.ir.iiry profersor himself.

That he is at the pacCMt in Episcopal waters does not make the rfrtflfllial Church nrspor.sable for him. George Macculloch Miller said last evening he '.1 not imagine that an trouble would come from r-r. Biiggs's address before the Church Club, but he had taker, the responsibility for calling the attention of Bishop Potter to it be cause he felt responsible for the appearance of Dr. Briggs before the club. He did not think, he said, that Dr. Brlgtrs would have any objection to uubmitting his manuscript for Bishop Pot ter's inspection. The trial of Dr. Hrlggs on charges of heresy lfore thf N-w-York Presbytery In 1892 created a sensation. Dr. Eripgs was acquitted by the Presbytery, but he was suspended by the jYesbjrterian General Assembly in 1893. He kept his professorship in t'nlon Theological I ary, however, and in iv.is h was or dalnel a pr.est in the Protestant Episcopal Church by Bishop Potter. ROB AXD GAG OPERATOR.

Crosst'es and other obstructions were piled on the track, but the attempt was discovered by a section hand before the arrival of the train. Mulat is in Santa Rosa County, nbout thirty miles from here. Sheriff Van Pelt and a deputy sheriff with bloodhounds have left here on a spactaj train to capture the wreckers. A Seaboard Air Line train was held up last night, and an attempt was made to hold up yet another train. The hold-up of the Seaboard train was unsuccessful, the robbere being driven off before they secured any booty. They blew up the express car with dynamite, thinking it was the man car. and tefore they could attack the mail car were driven off by pTsnors armed with rifles and shotguns. The conductor and engineer chased the robber down the track with th engine, but failed to catch them. It is thought that the hold-up men of to-night are the same as those who did the Jnb lapt niphr.

They passed tnrcugh exciting experiences, but return without treasure. With eight companions, they sailed from Nova Scotia en March 17 last for Terra del Fuego in a small schooner to loo for treason In kern quantities which Captain Mcleod, of the schooner, said was to be fooad there. The schooner was five months in reaching the Island and in a storm one of the party. Ashley Cooper. was washed overboard and drrwt. ... The vessel finally reached False Cove, Terra del Fuogo, but went aground In trying to land. Then McManut and Thompsoi quarrelled with the other, and. taking their belongings, set out with Indians on an expedition Into the Interior. For several weeks, the two young men lived on shellfish only, and endured great hardships while tramping over the country lot, kins tor elgns of gold. They had to tak turnn Standing guard at night to prevent being murdered by the natives. On striking the coast again they learned ih-.t their companions had got th vessoi off ihe beach and gone to some other place. They then procured a small canoe and m.ide s voyage of 12.. nes by soa, almost to Cape Horn, in a rajn search for treasure that Captain ftfcLieod had said existed there.

Jan. 17 Eighteen persons, dele gates to the convention of the National League of Commission Merchants, and their wives, were thrown into the icy water of Echo River, which winds through Mammoth Cave, and were saved only by the coolness of the guide, John Nelson, and the heroic work of Charles A. Muehlbron ner. of Pittsburg. The party included W. J. Harris, of Chicago Mr. and Mrs. O. S. Well, of Cincinnati L. S. Owens, of Chicago Frank K. Wagner, of Chicago John H. Barnett, of Chi cago L..

The roof of the cave over Echo River is arched, and the space In the centre, owing to an unaccountable rise in the river, wan only two and a half feet above the water. To Insure the passage of the boat the men an-i women were forced tn sto.ip over. At one place the Iwat swerved to one side, raking the heads of those next to the bank. They leaned further forward to escape striking their heads, and this lowered one end of the boat, causing It to take water rapidly. The guide saw th danger, and called to M Ifnehlbronner to Jump and tak the chain. This he did. landing on a steep, bank, which offered only a slight foothold. Lying down on his face, he held to th chain and pulled the boat toward the bank. The boat .sank m eight feet of water, but further hack, where there was DO landing, the water Is eighteen ft deep. By the light of a single lantern the party escape-i by climbing over Mr. Ifuehlbronner, and, after waiting several hour for a boat, were brought in safety to daylight. SNAG FOR DEMOCRATS.

It was learned to-night from the Boston headquarters of the National Ed nee - tional Association that it would flatly refuse to give uj its rights in St. Ixuis for the Matlonal CORTentien to accommodate the Democratic National Convention. Not a member of the ex ecutive board can be found who favors such a surrender Many of the members have engaged board and rooms In St. Ixuis for the fir.st week in July, and declare that the Democratic dele gates win have to take what is left. President Prltehett, of the Institute of Technology, says I do not know of anything that would do the Democratic National Convention more good than to have the National Educational Association meet In St. Louis while the Democrats are v.itb'i the sphere of such a healthful Influence. It would take at least three months to canvass the different National Educational Association bodies regarding a change in dates, and this the executive refuses to do.

II A RMOXY FA DES AWA V At a Little Dinner Plans Arc Laid to End the Peerless. froou Tnr. TRtxir-NE ntRE.r. 1 Was'.inton. Jan. 17 It is becoming evident that a the meeting of th Democratic National Committee, the so-called conservative element of fh party gained a powerful recruit from tbs Bryan camj. In the person of Senator Will iam J. Stone, of Missouri, while the actio.i cf the committee in sending the conventon to Ft. l.oiis not only solidified but embitterel the radical faction. Because of this pay of pol itics the prospect of harmony within the party lines disappeared from view, and the ladors of the Democracy are aghast at the prevailing spirit of dlaccrd. Senator Stone was formerly one of the fore most supporters of the Peerless Leader. and could be depended ii'von to reflect the wish.es of the NVbraskar. on all questions. Events follow ing the meeting of the cofmsjae, however, has disclosed tha. the Missouri leader, who Is vice chairman of th Democratic National Commit tee. has cut loose from his former affiliations and allied hlm.ef with the Eastern contingent. This defection from the Bryan ranks would be a serious blow to the plan of that faction to dictate the selection of, the Democrat' nominee were It not offset by the recruits who Hocked to the Hryf.n-Henrst standard when war was declared. On the nltfht following the adjournment of the committee Senator Stone grave a dinner, and amoni those prftOt were Charles F. Murphy, the Tammany leader National Committeemen Tagsjart, of Ind'r.n-i. Ouffey. of Pennsylvania, and NorrK of Netv-Hnmpshire, and Charles H. Jonr-s. formerly Editor of The St. Louis Re public, and few others known to be In favor of the nomination of a. candidate whom the Bryan followers eouM hardly indorse. None el the oldttrr.e- associates of th host were present, and no invitation was extended to any Democrat known to be friendly to Bryan. Chairman Jor.es was In the city, and so were Secretary Charles a. Wnfsh and many of the prominent members of th- committee, but they knew noth ing of th. dinner. The utmost secrecy pre valted. Many of those present went so far as to announce beforehand their intention of ing homo, and paid goodby to their friends. At the dinner the whole situation was dis cuesed, and it is understood that an agreement was reached whereby the Bryan-Hearst faction was to be fought to finish, with a view to making Impossible the nomination of th latter or any candidate bearing the Bryan tag. There was no unity of sentiment as t. whom they would rapport, but they were for any one who COUld overthrow the Bryan influence, which, it is conceded. will approximate one-third of the delegation to the Democratic convention next July. IIAXX.I SEES CORTELYOU. Rumors of Complete Republican Harmony Follow Interview. FROM THE TllinrNE ni'REAU. 1 Washington. Jan. 17. Secretary Cortelyou. of the Department of Commerce and Labor, called on Senator Hanna yesterday on business con nected with the McKinley monument fund and other affairs, and remained for a considerable time In conference with the Ohio Senator. As a result there is considerable speculation in the nlr and rumors of complete harmony In Repub lican ranks are in circulation. No one knows the precise character of the conference between the men named, and definite statements cannot therefore be made nt this time. Senator Hanna has returned from Ohio wear ing the laurels of an almost unprecedented vic tory, and gives every Indication of betas a man well pleased with himself and the world. There appears to be. however, a single cloud on Mr. Hanna'a horizon, and that is what he regards as evidences of intriguing in the party with a view to placing him In a false position. As lie seems to take this seriously to heart, it is pos sible that he will see fit. .'it no distant date, to declare himself in terms that will leave no room for doubt. It Is recalled that Mr. Hanna declared himself in almost the eleventh hour of the Ohio conven tion last fail, and was rounded with a record victory in Ohio. It Is still too early to make predictions, but it is certain that men cordially Interested n the welfare of the Republican party incline this evening 1 to take an STtrSMSIj cheerful view of tho future, and are remarking that good may COOM out of every storm that blows.

Sharp Rebuke to MoralesUnited States Sailors Guard Tug. San Domingo, Jan. 13 An incident which came near having serious results, which were averted by the prompt intervention of L'nited States Minister Powell, took place here on the arrival of the Clyde Line steamer New-York. President Morales demanded that the shipping agent surrender the ship' 3 letter, and when the agent refused his arrest was ordered. To avoid arrest the agent went on board the Nw-York. carrying the letters with him. He then sent for Consul Maxwell, who accompanied him to the palace, where President Morales renewed his de mand and compelled the agent to give up sev eral letters. Minister Powell, learning of the incident, promptly went to the palace and demanded that the letters taken from the agent be delivered to him. This President Morales refused to do, but Mr. Powell persisted in his demand, saying that the government had no right tro take such ac tion, and that the President must hand the let ters to him, which President Morales reluctant ly did. Mr. Powell also told President Morales that the agent was entitled tn his protection, as he represented an American company that he Minister Powc-I would not consent to this arbitrary act on the part of the government, and that, further, the agent could not be ex pelled, as was threatened. The case was at last satisfactorily Fettled. Mr. Powell, rinding that the government was unable to protect the tug Anna, which Is owned by Americans, unilt entering San Isidro, re -iiopted the commander of the T'nited States gunboat to guard her. The insurgents threat ened to capture the Anna, ar.'l this morning a strong guard ift the Newport to protect her and other vessels obliged to paa through the waters in that section. fTT. Pphera.

The revolutionary General Navarro having seized cattle on an estate at La Fe. which is an American property, the agent of the estate applied to Tatted States Minister Powell for protection. The mtatstet was compelled to refuse the request, as he has no force at his command sufficient to guard the estate. The force on the United States gunboat is too small to safeguard estates from pillagers, and In order to protect United States property thrre is a great need of a larger warship here. If the insurgents should enter the city now it would be impossible to prevent the pillage which would be sure to take place, and there is no other warship here to support the Newport should it be found necessary to land men. There was continued firing around the city last night and this morning. A shell from the enemy's camp entered a private dwelling house and Injured a child. There is great suffering among the poorer classes. RUSH TO BE SOLDIERS. Chinese Form a Brigade in San Francisco. r.V TELEcrt.ri to trb I BUD AS. San Francisco, Jan. 17.

Exceptions Which Make Rights Worthless Feeling in Tokio. Toklo. Jan. 17. The Associated Press corre spondent is informed on trustworthy authority that Japan has received a Kuaslan communica tion saying that Russia will reject the rights and privileges already acquired by the powe.l In Manchuria under existing treaties with China, excepting the establishment of foreign settle ments and in ss. far as these rights and priv ileges are not prejudicial to Russia's future re lations with Manchuria. Japan does not anticipate Russia's rejolnler for at least one week. In the mean time ths nation is prep.i and grimly reconciled war. Political and other distinctions have dis appeared and the country is united. The gov ernment Is receiving many offers of contribu tions, n case of war. amounting to many mill- ions of yen. The Japanese people would welcome an hon orable peace, but are resolved to fight before receding from their position in Oriental a.f s. They fear the aggression of Russia, and believe if t Is not stopped now it will never be stopped. They are confident that their demands are fais and moderate, and that their diplomacy, whlcls has been patient, has prone to a reasonable limit They expect the world's sympathy In the struggle, and have a splendid confidence in thetj a.y and navy. In the event of reverses or a national dteastwt it is thought that England and the United States would Intervene to preserve a balance of powen in Kaatern Asia. There is no fear of an in- vosion of Japan, r country which is probabljf the most strongly defended In the world. The growth of Brttlsh and American sentl-r nt is marked. Numerous displays of the flags of the two nations are made, and popular songs, re- citing the glories of the Lion and Uncle SarV' are sting. The characters of V- - and Johnny Bull are also seen at publio dances.

Dr. Pitrkhurst's sermon on lessons of the Chl rgo theatre fire, which in his absence was read fronc his pulpit last Sunday evening by an assistant, ss attracting considerable attention. and. to judge from published comments, is ex g more censure than approval. If there are those who think that Dr. Parkhurst has made special efforts of late, by excessive lndul fence 5n sensational modes of speech, to revive the blase of publicity in which he lived for 6ev ears, we shall not deny that there is 6ome Justification for that belief. It is probable that in this lostsnce he made a deliberate choice of etartlinx expressions, foresaw that it would be efay to draw false inference from what he aald and expected his sermon to provoke hostile criticism. The employment of surh methods is a matter of taste. We printed the more ttriklnj parts of Dr. Parkhurst's discourse on Monday raorulns, not for the sake of adding to his notoriPty, but be cue. in our opinion, they contained whole nme truth which need to be considered. With hit remarks on th eubject of public responsi bility for the enforcement of the lars It Is hanl ly possible for a reasonable citizen to disagree, and. ao far as we hae observed, they have not been disputed. It Is a fact that in a demo crtic rovernnem like our own the urgency of a etrtute the Relf-executing power of a statute Cles out of it Just as fast as the popular will fljes out of it thnt Is to Bay, Just so fast us the trarnte eeat to be the liriug expression of the popular determination. In Chicago pop nlar tension in respect to the building and nre ltwe had been relaxed, os It had been almost ererywhere, and they had become a dead let ter. There Is no fault to be found with Ir. Prkhurst's declaration that when a catas tror'he occurs under the circumstances that lrarked the catastrophe at Chicago, tlie funda ineutal responsibility is to be charged home to the community at large. But when he goes en to cay that the flre that burned those be hundred eople was God's flre Ills hostile critics ttir.lc they find their opportunity. If, however. Dr. Parkhurst had chosen to use a form of word which could not have been saMuterprrted, be iui-ht have aald tlie same thing with Impunity. The context. In spite of Its characteristic and. to borne minds, offensive phraeeolory. makes the meaulnp clear to a nkwCnl reader. The Almighty has established certain laws which we call the laws of Nature. Koine of His creatures are under tb impression that they could have made better one, but at til events thl stte of existence Is inconceiv able wirhout them and would be utterly lntol etame If they were capriciously enforced. Re cause Ihey are Inviolable, human beli are able to adapt their conduct to the conditions im posed upon them. We know that the nature of fire always is to blister always, not aome tlnx-an4 --c c t accordingly whan not forget It Wnen building is f u i f combuKtl blo materials and the draughts are open a spark win caus a conflagration unl MUe essr-mial Jenwit of fatal combination I. lacking. In the lon run the learnln- of that lesson is worth Ultco,t 6 . and It h 8 to be learned flrwh lhr I i for tatfdJty or indlffor ac. to that see, it is God's are. if n 0 In . tresU to tbwert the law or avert tLe conse qnenoM. fins wW be iem. Ur wi i onrf. Perhaps there are betBSS who have a I rftjfct to expect such protection, but, if so, we I have the satisfaction of knowinr that we occupy 1 a higher place in the scale of existence. When n man falls off a roof, God does not simultaneously suspend the law of praitatiou. When hnnber drops from n frdfht car in the way of an express tniin. lie does not remove' lt i for the sain of preweafttnsj a wreck, It is not an exnggeratiou to say that those who fall to pereef-e that, the humanly coTi'iiv.-l conditions rha pradsaiy what they were, the Chicago theatre tire was not merely ineriinble. but neces sary, ba-e not yet obtained a ana irrlp on the troth that order is preferable to chaos, it ap petrs to os that in these days Dr. Parkhurst Ifl at least ns likely to be wrong as right, but In tlIs ense h ii on solid ground.

There rere not many horses to be seen anywhere ti it we not pain fiiJly ritHlT and slidiu and struccrltng to keep tlioir footing. The amount of suffering Inflicted upon tlio belpteai animals ir. thta way was enor mona fir tuore than la ced by all the i ilofpin and oilier ill treatment which the law so well endeavors to ppwa The number of harsai erjapled that they had to be lillt ' was probably eeaUerable. r iiie amount of de lay and of obstruction to trafte was enormous. . Now, we sny that this was barbarous. It was cruel and stupid beyond description, because It vr, we say that this was barbaro. li Wai and stupid beyond description, beeauae it was unnecessary. It was not a drcmnsttnea beyond our control. It Is possible and easy to shoe a horse so that he will not slip on ice any more than on a clean macadam road. Some horses are so shod, for both Hscht and heavy driving. All should be po shod whenever there is need of It. Nor does that aioan that al horses should be renhod whenever the streets become slippery. There are practical methods of ehansinpr shoes There smooth to methods changing shoes from smooth to rough in a short time, without removing them from the feet, which onght to be more widely known than thwj are. All owners of horses hMill bve Reuse enouch and lmmnnlty enough, an'l enousrh regard for their own material profit, to make use of such devices whenever nf hhij If they do not. tt misrht be well to consider com pulsion. To have a horse fall unnecessarily 1 both an act of cruelty and an obstruction of the highway. If every time a horse falls because he is Improperly shod the driver or owner were arrested and fined, either for cruelty to the animal or for obstructing the street, we should Lave no more such ppectacles as that which yesterday discrreced the city. TUREK POiyTS IM EAST ASIA. The outlook in East Asia Is undoubtedly more peaceful, or perhaps we should say less war like. There are distinct indications that Rus- sia is Inclined to recede from pome, if not all, of her aggressive demands. That may be be cause the peace party, which is the party of progress and of the Czar, has gained dominance in Russia. It may be because of the all but universal sympathy with Japan expressed by the world. It may be because we have Rus sian authority for saying it of the resolute stand takeu by the United States in behalf of Its treaty rights. It raa be because as we are. now assured from Ber .in France hns grown weary of the one sided Russian alliance and has given Russia to understand that she will have no French aid in case of war, not even though other powers should ally themselves with Japan. Whatever the reason, the fact is patent, and is welcome. There are, however, three remaining points which need to be set tled. One Is suggested ry the Russian Viceroy of the Far East, Admiral Alexieff, through his diplomatic agent, M. I'lareon. in the declara tion that it was unfrieudly and undiplomatic for the United States to make a treaty with j Cnina without Russia's consent, and that Rus sia will not open the ports of Moukden and An- Tuijg. nor permit T'nited States consuls to go thither. That is a point which Admiral AlexleiT and the St. Petersburg government may need to Kettle between them. The course of tho United States is clear. It asks nobody's con sent to its treaty making with another sovereign power. It has made the treaty with China, and It Is 6endlas consuls to the two ports named. It expects that they will be properly receive,, ' and that those ports will be opened aud be kept i open to its commerce. So far as the American ' government pays nttention to Russian utter ances upon this Etibject, it does so to the dec laration of the Czar's accredited representatlvo at Washington, who only last week assured tho Secretary of State that Russia would place no obstacles in the way of our full enjoyment of our treaty rights in Manchuria. We hope and believe that Count Casslnl will prove to hiivo been a more accurate exponent of the Czar's policy than Admiral Alexieff. A second point Is that of foreign settlements in Manchuria, A St. Petersburg dispatch re ports thnt Russia tHI refuses to acquiesce in the treaty rights of foreign power to make set tlements la Mauchuria. though she is, of course, herself making such settlements there without j uumber and of jjreat extent. Japan, we are also told, Is inclined to contest this point, which j is considered vital. Certainly it does seem vital. TJie annulment of the right to make commercial Rettlcments would practically annul or destroy the value of all other rights and ' privileges. What good would it be to us to I iiave the right to trade in Manchuria if our I traders were not permitted to reside in Man- j churian ports Moreover, since Russia Is mnk ing nil the eettlemeuts it pleases her to make in Ifsnrimila. other nations must have the same privilege uuder the most favored nation clanse-a clause which i in ur treaty with China. The third point concerns tho Yalu River. Rus- ' sia Is said to have receded from her pretensions to the control of Corea. even of the northern half of thnt country, and to have admitted that it lies within Japan's sphere of influence. But she still Insists that a eonsidera strip along the northern border of Corea, comprising the Oorean banks of the Yalu and Tiuinen rivers, ' f-hali bo declared a neutral zone, in which Japun 1 make no fortifications or settle ment. But Russia herself already has Bane settlements within It. It does not appear that he hP.s consented ioabandon and withdraw , from them. Moreover. Russia absolutely re- i fnaee even to eonsSder JapanTi suggestion that a similar strip should b- neutralized on the. ' UaacSmrtan side of the Une. Tl Russian p iau j seems to be that Russia filial be permitted to ettie alone axd forUfj- th Chlnesa Eid ot the YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. THURSDAY. OUARY 21. 190-4 1 Yalu as much as she pleases, but Japan must leave the Corcan side entirely open and unde j feuded. That i taid to be unacceptable to i Japan. We should tliink it would be. Ve expect that the United States Vill settle 1 for ttaeif the matter ef the caewtng of the ports and the establishment of Its consuls there, ami that it will do BO la a manner sattltaCtery to jircf and without any breach of the peace or even of friendship with Russia. The other two matters Japan has la band for settlement, and it is intimated that she considers tliem of -utli cient Importance to warrant her lv Koin to j war over them if a settlement cannot be ef 1 fected by peaceful means. It would be lamen table to hajre a war. Cut we cannot truly say i that Japan seems to overestimate the impor tance oi those points. It is to be hoped that , Russia will come to a recognition of the justice of .Japan's contention, and will gracefully re j cede on those points, as she is believed already to have done on others. In that way peace will probably be assured. There seems to be. no as surance it on any other ground. OOTBR OR VARDAXAJra POLICY. Tho new Governor of Mississippi in his in angural a'.Mress says exactly what was to be expected from him. lie was chosen by the re actionary elements over men who stood for progress and justice to the ne.ro as an expres sion of their bitter spirit toward President Koosevelt because ho recognized the equal rights of negroes .as dtiaena under the law. Governor Vardaman charges that the negro race is as a whole rapidly deteriorating, mid ihat education, instead of preventing crime, pro motes it. lie marshals figures to show that the negroes of the North, who are better educated ihan their Southern fellows, ure also more criminal. He asks for an amendment to the State constitution authorising the legislature to distribute the school fund between the races at it discretion, so as to turn all taxes paM by white persons to white Khoolfl anl keep the negroes in practically entire Illiteracy. This has been a favorite ambition of h's school of pii ticians in several Southern States, but they have so far been signally defeated whenever the issue hns heeii squarely made, and against them are all the most Intelligent white leaders In the South, the oollejre presidents of Southern birth and education and progressive politicians like Governor Ayeock of .North Carolina. Thpe men are as determined as anybody to maintain the supremacy of white civilization in the Booth, but they realize that the only way to solve the race problem is to do justice and help the negro to advance. The South cannot k half its population In barbarism without itself being barbarized. The statements of Governor Vnrdaman about the retrogression of the negroes iiro contra dicted by those of hundreds of unprejudiced ob orver. They are steadily Increasing their wealth, and coming more and more to a realiza tion that there is no short cut to prosperity, but thnt they must follow Booker Washington's fidvice and by hard and honest work nnd good Conduct make themselves respected. Undoubt edly after the abolition of slavery the negro were Impracticable In their aspirations. It was inevitable that they should be. but that they have not made progress, and astonishing prog res, in view of their condition and antecedents, is not true. Perhaps no race starting frntn utter savagery ever advanced faster thnn the negro race in the United States. The statistics of criminal negroes in the North are not fair to the race. Ft is largely the adventurous who come North, seek the cities and take on tha ices of the whites. The necros who nr edu cated ns their own wisest leaders wlah are not criminals. They nre working on f.-trnis nnd in trade, trying to mnke honest Urines hiul help their fellows on the same road. They are teach ing and preaching the gosi v of work They want to mnke useful. Intelligent citizens. Gov ernor Vardaman's policy would mako uuinte gent helots. XSrO RTA Tlo WUIBA XCES. The people of this city bv been trented to two Innovations in transportation during tho last few dny. The more Important as well as The more recent of them wns lutroduced v the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx. in con formity with a municipal ordinance adopted last year. Surface cars are now required to stop on the near crossing. instead of the fur ther one. to discharge and take on passengers. In defence of the plan it may be urged that it assimilates the practice on ono side of the East River with that which has long boon followed on the other. Inasmuch as a considerable num ber of the people who make use of one set of facilities patroatop the other also, something would be gained by insuring uniformity of habit The chief merit of the system, however is that it minimizes the risk of collision with teams moving through cross streets at right angles with tho street railways. The risk, no doubt has been Increased by the substitution of eee trtctty for cables and horse p, er, beeiiuso higher speeds are vow possible than formerly. All Ihe same, the public inconvenience which attends the new usage will always be so great aa to outweigh these considerations. In line weather it does not matter where the cars stop. When snow, slush or mud prevails, it is litUe Short of an outrage to compel passengers to em bark and alight forty or fifty feet from a cross walk. That ordinance ought to bo repealed promptly, and when such action is takeu the city fathers may well consider the propriety of restoring to Brooklyn the custom observed thero ten or twelve years ago. Another change, made experimentally by the Brooklyn Itnpid Transit Company, affects traffic on the bridge on Sundays. Local trains are then taken off, and an attempt is made to pro vide for those patrons who wish merely to cross the river by carrying them on elevated railway trains. The latter stop tirst at one plat form for through passengers, and then at a second for local passengers, the rear car being reserved for those who expect to leave at the Brooklyn terminal. Uuferttmately, the number of people standing on the ancoud platform in the Manhattan station is often too great to h accommodated in a single coach. Much vexa tion and delay result at the outset, therefore. Still further trouble is experienced on the other side. Only a part of the passengers who there alight from tiie rear probably not over half want to go down to the fltreet. A considera ble number wish to take certain elevated rail way trains nt that point. In order to do so they must follow an unusual route. They are not permitted to .stay ou the platform where they alight until they reach the staircase lead- S-ig upward to the elevated station. They arc required lirst to go down one flight, in order to buy tickets. Thus they Jostle those people who are bound for the street, exhibit excusable un certainty about the proper disposition of their tickets, and drive the rapid transit employes nearly frantic with their questions nnd blun ders. It does not take long to discover a possible remedy for these vexations. If, In accordance with the evident intention of the company, all who want to travel on elevated roads would esahnrk at tho first platform in the Manhattan siatlon, there would probably be plenty of room In the rear car for strictly local passengers, who would have no further cause for complaint. The people who chare these accommodations with them, it is asserted, are aiming for the Ridgewood and U Itpnave, lines. Access to these can be Uad hi two ways. Cue can etart from Manhattan on a Fifth-aye. or Bath Beach train and transfer nt Bridge-st., or he can go across the river with the local passengers v,v transfer at the Brooklyn terminal. Each plan has its drawbacks, a. F.ridge-st. one is lss certain of securing a scat than at High-st., but to make the change at fhe former point takes less rime and trouble than- at the latter. From the behavior f at least a few of those who in sist oa effecting the transfer at the Brooklyn terminal of the bridge, it is apprm m tlj.it they are comparative strangers, and not regular pitnis. Perhaps the others, who have hitherto chosen their route deliberately, may be per suaded to adopt the plan propoeed by the Rapid Transit Company, The experiment may work better after a little further trial. COLD WEATHER. Frostbitten Ameri as they rub their sitinrlnK ears ur.J beal together their numbe 1 fKers, complain bitterly that this winter is elmost bntelerahle. CouM their sufTerir.ss h alleviated by calUnc to mind that the Taajea In England in M 63, and as-ain In 1T1'. was frozen over for many weeks so solidly that fairs were held upon the Ice stiffened surface of the stream In 12 U. so it ts s.ild, parts of the Mediter ranean Sea were crossed on ice. We all bear in m'r.'l the horrors of the retreat from Moscow of.

A remarkable tale comes from Oklahoma about village rivalry with tragic results. Snyder nnrt Mountain lark are rival towns three miles apart, separated by a creek. For sonio time Snyder has been luring people away from Mountain Park, the Inilnceinrnts offered being tree lots in tho tormei town an.l the removal of their Mountain Park tons to the new sites free of charge. To facilitate the moving of the houses a bridge was built across the creek. Naturally the relations between the two towns became intense. Thursday afternoon citizens or Mountain Park succeeded In buying the bridge and petting a bill of sale. Then, alter dusk, they want down to the creek with their workmen to destroy the bridge. Citizens of Snyder had learned of the sal and were in ambush on the creek's bank. wait ing for them. The first volley dropped half a dozen of the Mountain Park men. The Snyder men, per haps frightened at what they had done, retreated to their village, pursued by the other crowd with execrations and rifle shots. At latest advices all the able bodied men on either side of the creek were armed to the teeth, and federal deputy marshals were bustling to the assistance of the Sheriff of Ktvwa County in his efforts to command and en force the peace.

She Says Gordon Knows Nothing of Gettys burg Except by Hearsay. UT TKLEiir.AiTI TO THE TBIBUNB.I Atlanta. Ga.. Jar.. 3. Mrs. EUen Dortch Tjongstreet. widow of General James Longstreet, the Confederate commander who died yesterday, has replied to the charges that he lost the battle of Gettysburg, recently reiterated by General Gordon. She says that General Gordon occupied a subordinate position at Gettysburg, and hence knows nothing of thi matter at ilrst hand, and continues It is nlnlflcant that not one word was ever uttered against Longstreet's military record until the man who could forever fttlenca the calumny was In his mill the knightly soul of Hobert Edward Lee hail passed Into eternity. General L.onStreet'a operation at Gettysburg were above th suspicion of reproach until i nir. under the political ban of tha South, by meeting, as he saw it. the require ments of good citizenship in the observance of his Appomattes parole. Then the storm broke. He was hf-rnldeii as traitor, deserter of his people. rte-rter of Democracy, etc. In the fury of this onslaught orlKlnated the cruel slander that he had disobeyed Lee's most vital orders, causing the loss of th Gettysburg battle and the ultimate fa'l of the Confederate cause. The eetional complaint that hf deserted D mooraey, Is about as relevant and truthful a the assertion thai h lost Gettysburg He was a West I'eU.'er, a professional soldier he had never casi a ballot before the Civil War he had no politic its pensions and prejudices had no dwelling place In his mind. '1 he war was over, and he quietly ac cpted the result, fraternrzln with nil American. It was no great crime. Hut the peculiar cirfum- Stancet favored the copjiplracy to make Longtreet the loop desired scapegoat for Gettysburg. There was an ulterior and deeper purpose, however, than merely besmtiching hla military record. Short- Blghted partisans seemingly argued that the dis paragement of T-onftstreff was necessary to ray the. inlltary reputation of l.cc. But Lee's great fame needed no surh sacrifice. Th outrageous charges against Lonpstreet have been wholly disproved Much of the partisan ran cor that once pursued him has died out. Many of the more intHURf-nt Southerners have long been convinced that he was the victim of a great wrong. GENERAL LONGSTREET'S FUNERAL. Gainesville. Ga., Jan. 3.

Plan Said to Have Been Approved by Russian Emperor. Paris. Jan, 3. The St. Petersburg correspond ent of the Paris edition of The N r ew-York Her ald says that as a result of a consultation between the Emperor and hlh officials a plan has been worked out which may avert war. The plan, the correspondent says, contemplates a guarantee by Russia of the Integrity of China with the unclerstandin that Russia's protectorate over Manchuria be recognized, and in return Japan will be allowed to fulfil her wishes with respect to Corea. RUSSIA SEEKS DELAY. Report That Reply of Evasive Char acter Has Been Sent. London, Jan. 4. Th Daily Telegraph's Tokio correspondent says Russia bas sent a further reply to Japan. I understand It Is of a non-committal character, making merely for delay.' JAPAN DETERMINED. Steps Taken to Secure Protection of Interests in Corea. London. Jan. Do not look for a decla ration of war. gays The Daily Telegraph's Toklo correspondent In a dispatch, which ap parently throws considerable light on the plans of the Japanese government. Continuing, the correspondent says The Japanese are quite determined, and sev eral days ago toon steps to secure certain of their Corean interests. Russia will not be al lowed to occupy Corean ports, and certainly neither Mokphe nor Mesanpho. both of these ports being protected against seizure. Japan means business without waiting for the convenience of others. If Russia feels aggrieved, a fortnight should show the extent to which sh will venture The interest should begin at a centre nearer Seoul than Tokio within ten days, but the naval overture may retard the piece It is thought despite her bluster that Russia will take no immediate action to prevent Japan doing what she thinks proper to safeguard her Interests In Corea. The foregoing probably refers to the dispatch of the squadron to Masanpho. Admiral Kural mura's squadron consists of the armored cruis ers Asama. Toklwa, Azuma. Idsum. Iwate and Yakum, all with a speed of from SO to 23 knots. According to The Standard's Tokio corre spondent, Japan at the end of December In formed the powers, Including the United States, of the actual position of the negotiations, at the same time Intimating that the continued occupation of Manchuria might compel Japan to take decisive steps for the protection of her vital Interests in Cor.-a. The correspondent of The Dally Mall at Shanghai asserts that the Wal-Wu-Pu, or Chi nese Foreign Hoard, has received a definite com munication from St. Petersburg to the effect that Russia Intends to retain Manchuria. The Standard's Tien-Tsin correspondent says that as a result of Japan's Inquiries as to China's attitude In case of war. it Is stated that the throne has Issued secret orders t Chines troops to assist the Japanese. It la proposed that a Chines army of 40. men un.'.r Japanese officers would. In that case, pro reed to the Liao-Tung Peninsula, ' Th. Daily Graphic says that it has tht highest authority to deny that Germany has entered Into any understanding with Russia, or any other power affecting . her neutrality In case of a Rnaao-Japanese war. The Daily Mall is authority for the state ment that Ktntc Edward greatly admires the Japanese, and is u.-iis every effort in the direc tion of peace.

Peking, Jan. 3. ln thp various foreign lega tions here the opinion Is prevalent that war be tween Japan and Russia Is Inevitable. This opinion is based on the latest dispatches from Toklo and on the conviction that It is not a question of details which separates Russia and Japan, but th vital principle as to whether Jap. in paaweaea the risht to a voice in the set tlement of questions connected with the Russian occupation of Man-huria. Russia has all along denied this right, and unless her reply unex pectedly shows that she has receded from this position t will probably provoke an ultimatum from Japan, whose determination to resort to aims In support of her claim is unquestioned. General Yuan-Shi-Kai. conimanUer-ln-chief of tho army ar.ci -avy. has memorialized the throne praying to be relieved from all his minor offices so that he may devote all hts energies to the reorganisation of the anr.y.

Bat be had longed to do to, and to him, sa well as to the fighting man. that threat of a friendly all had recurred, though not bus own Jesting answer. It had even recurred more than once when scanty news made him fearful, but ho would have been immensely surprised to see i' fulfilled at any tite. He is among the most practical of nun. Tl . was li'ht Jack would have known a bettor wa with debts of In nor. in the house where Colonel Pale was a guest he enjoyed the perfect liberty of an old and dear comrade. It was not until the fourth day that he could think of his purpose resolutely. The Vharfe was In spate then, after rain among the hills, and he out to fish with worm below those woods In which the Stiid is situated. His host being no fisherman, Colonel Bale took with him, by an arrangement made overnight, an old water bailiff of whom be was fond. They reached the Btrid about the luncheon hour. The spate had fallen and left the rocks exposed, and the place looked more than ever fitting for his design, a suicide to be accom plished without suspicion i another man's presence. Colonel Sale took a dram with him and ate a sandwich, arid they watched the water thunder down. It is a boiling white cataract between pray walls of granite, and below it a long, deep pool Ues. AH had gone well for the ncr evasion. It . .- the old man himself who had suggested that some of the upper reaches should be tried, a be Kn- i them best, and the recks ere slipi ry.

He was lo king Intent at first, as if I I recognised bis friend, but bis red fa' c relaxed In the- funny little smile down hits nose tLat Bale knew. He danced a little above the torrent, came out on the point of the dij pins rock and dropp d over. net Bale let him speak the first word. It wa.s a dur.b show, like everything els- he had done in the cataract's roar, and, for the fir3t time in life, the nan who would have relin quished life so boldly was at a loss from fear, j ka livii and warm grasp gave him a shock, moreover. Instantly ho drew Jack away, but with a band which became viseHke, and with Batch evident nervousness, that his friend was shocked at the chance In hi'ii. Privately Jack swore at the war for it, yet thought it strang In su h a gallant man. He was pulled up to the fringe of a woodd bank beforx U.- Colonel spoke.

They went down to the hotel, and there tho afternoon was whiled away with talk of olii times, as if no mystery had spun fit.- threads between them. it was ov r the after dinner smoke that both men cams to an awkward silence. For Ja. k, at any rate, this was not endurable he waited for some more intimate talk, hoping good from it, and then set about with deliberation to put his friend at ease. He said, very quietly I know what you're thinking of, Art. The Colonel controlled himself with dlflcutty. He bad little doubt left just at that moment that Jack had seen through his bad acting, but he looked up. saw him admiring th- ash of his cigar, and still k.pt silence, dreading the word that would shatter eelf-respect. Tou're as superstitious as ever wondering what the deuce that 'coincidence' portends of my turning up so adroitly. Oh, I know you of old He laugbc I gently. My dear fellow, I'm sorry to disabuse you, but it's simply no coin cidence at all.

Altbo . rol of most of the fruits of her victory by the intervention of Rus sia, Germany and France, and forbidden to oc cupy the peninsula of Liao-Tung, which would have placed Corea in the centre of Japanese do minion, the island empire did not abandon her ancient . . tion. By means of repeated trea ties and conventions, the Japanese have gradu ally increased their financial and commercial inJiu- nee over the Corean government. Jai in, accordingly, resents Russian Intrusion because of the great amount of Japanese capi tal invested la Corea. At the present time Japan has a practical monopoly in the construction of Corean railroads. Japanese banks have been established throughout the peninsula. The bulk of the carrying trade of Corea is with Japan, and in the year 1902 1,241.43-1 tons of shipping entered Corean ports, of which 39L310 tuxis were Japanese exports. The mo vital reason why the Japanese covet Corea la because this part of the Asiatic conti nent afford. the Bole stepping stone for the con tinental expansion of their empire. It is only fifty miles from the little Japanese Island of Tsu Shima, which ties in th Corean Strait, hall way between Japan and Corea, to the Corean port of Fusan. Russian Siberia occupies th- roast to the north of Corea, Russian Manchuria lies to the east, and the Chinese shore to the southward is being pre-empted by England, Jer many and Italy. Should Corea be taken away, Japan would - compelled to abandon her latter day dream of a continental empire, and to re main in her ancient Island isolation.

Since l v '.n, when ii.- Russians obtained a tim ber cutting concession in the Tain Valley, St. Petersburg statesmen have been more and man vigorously contending that the boundary line is not the river itself, but its southern watershed. Such an interpretation would embrace a rich lice ofr the top of ancient Corea.

The St. Petersburg corre spondent of the Lokal Anzeiger gives a much more serious view of the Far Eastern situation than has hitherto been sent from that capital. The correspondent rays he has authentic in formation that those in ofiki.-.l cir es entertain a greater concern over the difficulties between Russia, and Japan than they have heretofore allowed to become known to the public, and adds the suspicion that tlio utterances of the pre33 have been colored In order to conceal th3 official disquiet. The Czar takes the keenest interest In bring ing order into the complicated situation, and he insists that an unvarnished report shall b made public. Recently Count Lamsdorff, the Foreign Min ister General Kur.opatkln. the Minister of War, and M. Avnsi. chairman cf the committee on Eart Asiatic affairs, assembled ir. the Palace of Tsarskoe-Selo to draw up a communication which will soon be published in the government Magjer. This communication will give a complete stcry of the negotiations with Japan, Including the latest development v The corre spondent says The Czar v.ishes, as he told Count Lamsdorff. hat the whole truth shall bo given to the pub lic He is personally esainsrt war, and refuses to believe that It wil come. He hopes to con vince Japr.n that Russia's wishes ere reasonable and must be NSpsctSSl Accordingly the communication chiefly em braces flve points.

NEW- YORK OUT OF THE RACE. Before a conference this afternoon between Benator McCarren, Chairman Jones cf the ra tional committee, Norman E. Alaclt, New-York's member of the Democratic National Committee, and others representing the South and West, it had been determined to urge the claims of New- York vigorously, but the discussion apparently changed this intention. Views were exchanged which made It apparent to the New-Torksrs that there was a determined and aggressive ele ment in the committee antagonistic t the - lection of New- York, and the argume.' set. forth were of such a character as effectually to put an end to the efforts for the selection of that city. The name of New-York will be perfunc torily presented, but beyond this It Is not likely that anything will be done. Chicago is unquestionably the choice of a ma jority of the committee, ar.d this choice 13 backed up by the sentiment of the rank anl file of the party. Little is hearl in favor of the selection of St. Louis, although that city stands ready with a 40, guarantee should her claims be favorably considered, and Mayor Ro'lo 'Wells, ex-Mayor Walbridge and a dele gation from the St. Louis Business Men As sociation are in charge of the boom. The Chicago boomers were not only the firt to arrive, but they h.ive made thoir presence felt. They are also in possession of the gootts in the shape of a certified check for 10,, which can be had frr the asking. The only equi valent they want Is the selection of their city for the convention. The Chicago delegation is head ed by National Committoeman Gahan ar-.i Stato Chairman Hcr.kina, while it also has the assist ance of the magic persuasiveness or J. Hamilton Levs, formerly a Representative in Conre of wide reputation for e'.oiuencc. correct dresa and whiskers.

FIRE AT THOMAS VAULT. yew Tomb at TarryUrwn Badly Da 77 a Incendiary Suspected. A flre on Thursday night, which, it is thought, was of incendiary origin, damaged the new vault that the heirs of General Samuel Thomas are building in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. The vault had just been accepted by the archi tect, and the men were to finish work to-day. As r.o ore raw the blaze, for the vault is far from any houses it burned Itself out. Most of the damage was Cone by heat. The entire base on the west and north fides was ruined, and over the doorway the marble is etalneu by finoke. The vault will have to be taken down and rebuilt. The representative of the architect is positive that the fire was started by some firebug. During the cold weather the men hive had a stove burning 1 near the vault, fnd this was covered with a large canvas. The representative says the fire in the stove was entirely out before he '.eft it, and the condition of the stove seems to sustain this statement. It Is not damaged at all, and the coal in it Is un turned. Mrs. Thomas went to the cemetery yesterday, and was much affected by the sight of the ruined vault. She would not discuss the matter, simply saying It can't be helped now. The vault is one of the finest in the cemetery, and cost between iGo.oo and IUMu. It was built of white marble and granite.

Waldorf Policeman Saves Crowd. The running away of a team of Normandy horses, attached to a heavy wagon, in Fifth ave. at Thirty-ninth-st.. at 230 p. m. yester day, resulted in injuries to Superintendent Ma bon of Bellevue and allied hospitals, his two daughters. Patrolman William V. Ryan, of the Broadway Squad David Collins, driver for Dr. Mabon, ar.d Gustavo Woif, a cabman. Five teams were run into and more or less damaged. The runaway horses were caught at Thlrty eecond-st., after passing the Waldorf-Astoria, and almost grazing a number of women and children. The horses were attached to a heavy wagon owned by J. PatehetPfui, a wine dealer, of No. 278 Seventh-aye., and were driven by Augustus Chapius, of No. 124 West Tv.enty-flfth-st. He had left the horses standing in front of a store at Thirty-ninth-st. and Fifth-aye. while he wont in to collect a bill. Something frightened tho animals and they started down Fifth-aye. on the run. As they neared Thirty-fourth-st. the shouts of the spectators warned Patrolman Ryan, of the Broadway Squad, who was on the crossing from the Waldorf across Fifth-aye. A crowd of women and children was on the crossing at the time.

All fell in heaps, but none were injured. Ryan, however, was not so fortunate. In trying to get the people out of the way he was struck by the hordes and thrown headlong into a snow pile. Ilia shoulders and one side were Injured, but ho remained on duty. The team was going downhill so fust that the wagon swung from side to side and beat almost a. tattco in striking other vehicles that bad been hurriedly pulled to one side. Many carriage and w sons were struck, an 1 drivers had trouble in quieting their horses. At Thirty-second-st. a phaeton containing superintendent Mabo.n and his two daughters. Rose, twelve, and Margaret, ten yean old. driven by Collins, was unable to get out the runaways' path. The heavy wagon crashed into the phaeton, and all its occupants were thrown to the .street. Collins, the driver, was cut about the head and both hands. Dr. Mabon and his daughters were cut and bruised. They nil started for BetleVTM Hospital for treatment. The runaways swerved to one side and truck a cab driven by Gustave Wolf, of No. ISO Wvst Sventeenth-st. Wolf was thrown from the coachman's seat as if from v. catapult and landed on his head in the snow. He was not seriously injured. The horses by this time, through the many bumping and collisions, had been forced to slow up considerably, and a num ber of people closed In on them and captured them. Chapius was arrested, arraigned in Jefferson Market court, and lined .. on a charge of negli gence. 7IG7 LICENSE SUCCESS. Receipts Increase -2,300, As I any Certificates.

Would Raise 8,, a Year for CanahThh City Affected. BY TEl,Ei,nni T THE TnJBIXE.I Albany. Jan. 15. Discussion by legislators during the present week of the probable method of taxation which will be employed to raise the money necessary to build the new barge carial has disclosed a rather striking unanimity of opinion that at lenst one measure which the Governor had in his mind at the time he sent his message to the legislature was a record tax on mortgages. The assertion was made at the Capitol this week by a person entirely familiar with the subject of taxation that it was the gen eral impression in Haw-York City among those who had given the matter careful thought that the Governor's plan when it was finally made public would be purely and simply this, the tax being in all probability five mills. Such a tax would raise approximately 3,, annually, the sum which, it will be remembered, the Gov ernor believed sauld be necessary for the first two years. It will he recoiled that in his last message Governor OdJl called the attention of the legis lature to the subject of a mortgage tax, and aid, with what was believed at the time to be of considerable significance Much of the assessment in New-York City is occasioned by taxation upon mortgages, which should not ext. and which Is a positive, burden o ry, ar.tl ii frequent ens tVi5 . Zm per c l ' tJr.ni jli n bn t'r treatment of this class of personal property in its contribution to the expends of government fir would tend to minimize the unjust proportion cf payment of taxes. In two previous messages Governor Odell has dealt with the question of a, mortgage tax. an 1 has recommended the abolition of the direct tax and a one and two mill record tax. He Is known ctill strongly to advocate the abolition of the direct tax. but it is the opinion of those who are best Informed on the subject that the abolition la a matter which requires several years more of education for the public. ThU opinion was expressed only the other day by a New- York City oAetal whose ideas carry weight in this matter. The prevailing notion is that both in his reference In the message and In his two previous recommendations of a more di rect character the Governor foreshadowed the line of action that he believes the legislature should take in raising the 101,.1tO, necessary for the construction of the canal. This new record tax will not affect, it la gen erally believed, any existing mortgages, but sim ply apply to new mortgages. The minimum sum raised annually by such a tax la estimated at dBOQiIi That this may be too low an es timate, and that the Governor has been able to figure a larger income, is also suggested. The burden of this tax, as, indeed, of any tax for the canal, would fall on New-York City, and it has been reasoned that there will be a con siderable effort made to defeat such a measure, although, of course, until the matter la definitely known, no action can even be conjectured. It lv, however, an undoubted fact that it Is along this line that the real estate and financial In terests are looking- for the taxation plan. The question of when this important measure would be Introduced has naturally occasioned more or less guessing. It was said at the Capitol yesterday, with some show of credibility, that whatever measure was Introduced to meet this necessity would not make Its appearance before the middle of February. The only canal interest of present. Importance is the appoint ment by the Governor of the canal commission. The names of this board are expected next week. K. A. Bond, State Engineer, Is generally be lieved to be Elated for a place on this commis sion. DUKE SOUGHT DIVORCE. Philip of Orleans Revoked Petition at Emperor's Request. Vienna, Jan. I.. The Allgemeine Zeitung says that Duke Philip of Orleans is seeking a divorce, and that, he has petitioned the Curia for a dispensation to enable him to marry the daughter of a great Austrian noble. The All gemeine Zeitung asserts that the duke con sulted the leading members of the Royalist party last summer and Informed them of his intentions, giving as a renson that his present union was childless and that he desired to con tinue the royal line. The Royalists endeavored to dissuade the duke from taking the action be proposed, and pointed out to him that his divorce end remarriage would scandalize Cath olic circles in France, the chief supporters of the Royalist cause. Investigation In well Informed circles shows that it was the duke's intention to obtain a divorce from the arebducheaa, but that through the personal intervention of Emperor Francis Josopll the differences of the couple were ad justed, the duke withdrawing his petition to the Curia. The wootaa whom the duke desired to marry is said to be the Princess Clementine, daughter of Pauline, Princess de Metternlch-Sandor. It is said that the strong devotion of the arch duchess to duty is displeasing to the duke. The archduchess has repeatedly tried to induce the duke to live as a more consistent claimant to the throne of France. Duke Louis Philip Robert, head of the Bourbon- Oi leans hiMse. married i- 106 th Archduchess ilirlc Dorothea of Austria. ON DE KALB-AVE., LOOKING TOWARD CENTRAL, AYE. T0 BAR THE DARDANELLES BRITAIN WARNS RUSSIA. Pressure on Porte to 'Allow Black Sea Fleet's Passage. Berlin. Jan. 15. That Russia has applied to Turkey for permission to send her Black Sea fleet through the Dardanelles is confirmed authoritatively here, and it is also asserted that Russia will renew the application and press for Turkish consent. Germany's attitude, un changed from the time the four unarmed Rus sian torpedo boat destroyers passed through the straits in September, 1002, 13 that she has no concern in the matter. The British government Is believed here to have identified itself more fully week by week with the Japanese position, until now Great Britain is almost as deeply committed as Japan. The position In which Great Britain now stands, according to the view taken of the situation here, brought about by public opinion and by the feeling that Russia would yield If only a firm altitude were shown, has impressed and Is Impressing the Russian statesmen. The readiness with which the United States associated herself with Japan In pressing for the signature of the commercial treaties with H ajrei rVlt'ntrinutvii fittif in'fit. Ptersaure that This is not the moment to fight. The decision for war or peace now rests with the Czar's advisers, and symptoms are visi ble here that the decision will be peace, by large ly admitting Japan's demands. The views of the British editors, partially de rived from the Foreign Office in London, are looked upon hero not only as significant, but as part of a great diplomatic game against Russia. The skill Japan has shown through the negotia tions excites admiration at the German Foreign Office. London. Jan. 13. The report published in the United States by a r.ews agency to the effect that the British government had informed Japan that any attempt of tae Russian Black Sea fleet to pass the Dardanelles would be checked by de cisive action is untrue. Lord Lansdowne to-day, however, expressed disbelief that Russia had any intention of trying to send a fleet through the Dardanelles, adding that it would be an ob vious breach of treaty in which Great Britain could not possibly acquiesce. By the Treaty 0 London, signed in 1841 by the five great powers of Europe nnd by Turkey, the Sultan was pledged to maintain the rule of the Ottoman Empire which prohibited the warships of any foreign power from entering the Dardanelles while Turkey was at peace, and, at the same time, the treaty bound the powers to observe this rule. This was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris In 1556 and by the Convention of IS7I. which set forth that tho principle of closing the straits, such as It has been established. Is maintained. At the Berlin Congress on the Eastern question, in 1878. the Russian plenipotentiaries Insisted, in reply to a statement mad by Lord Salisbury, that. In their opinion. the principle of the closing of the straits Is a European principle, and that the exist ing stipulations are binding on all th powers, not only as regards the Sultan, but as regards all the powers signatory to these transactions. The Treaty of Berlin, ratified August 3. ISTS. provided that tho Treaty of Paris of 1556 and the Treaty of London of 1S1 were maintained when not modified by the new treaty, thus continuing the enforcement of the rule. TROOPS ALONG RAILWAY.

ML Senator M. A. Hanna said here to-night I have sent out 2. personal letters denying that I am a candidate for the Presidency, and I do not want to be considered as such. I con sider all such talk a 'closed incident. 1 The al leged opposition to the nomination of President Roosevelt has been overestimated and magnified greatly by Democratic papers and others with Democratic proclivities. Senator Hanna said that he would issue the call for the Republican National Convention in a few days. It had been delayed on account of the talk about Chicago hotel keepers advanc ing their rates. THE CONVENTION CALL. Hanna Friends Express Indigna tion at Rumors of Treachery. WOll THE TKIBVXB BrsSAU. 1 Washington, Jan. lo. Friends of Senator Hanna in Washington. Including Senator Scott, Of West Virginia, profess indignation thru thy I rumor of underhand dealing on the si rj a he .- . r..x tp iui,-'-.' c ...-. t . oltniU these aiapatcii'Vu.it r.h. .-pol1 have been made public. Thy assert that Sena tor Hanna Is too hlghminded a politician and too , fair a fighter to permit of his doing anything underhanded, and declare that there is no studied attempt to withhold the call for the national convention. They also add numerous excuses for the delay In calling the convention, reciting Mr. Hanna's ill health and Mr. Heath's press of business matters. Those leaders whose devotion to the President is unquestioned are disposed to accept the ex cuses in good part, and express gratification that the postponement of the call is not the re sult of any studied attempt, frankly admitting that they were disappointed that the national chairman did no find it convenient to come to Washington and issue the call as soon as his re-election to the Senate had taken place, in stead of returning to Cleveland, but they feel certain that, now the attention of the Senator from Ohio has been called to the importance of prompt action, he will permit no further delay. With regard to the publication of the report, which was in general circulation at the Capitol yesterday. It is believed that its effect cannot but prove beneficial. It is but one of several rumors, similar in their import, which have been in circulation in the last two weeks, and its publication has afforded the friends of Senator Hanna an opportunity to explain the delay and deny any purpose of inconveniencing the friends of the President. It has further served to make plain the desire of those Republicans who have the best Interests of the administration at heart to hold early conventions. Senator Hanna is expected in Washington at an early date. pOF3ibly to-morrow, and will, it is believed, immediately issue the call for the national convention. It is regarded as desira ble that all doubt as to the unity of the party in its support of the President be promptly .Im pelled, and the calling of the State conventions and the relection of delegates to the national meeting will do much to dispel any lurking doubt which may exist. As a matter of fact. Senator Penro.se has felt it desirable to issue the cull for the Pennsylvania convention without waiting for the national call, and has to-.ay sent out the notices which were prepared yester day and held up only because of the ruiror pub lished In The Tribune this morning. Mr. Pen rose is still in Philadelphia, presumably con ferring with Senator Quay, but he telegraphed to Colonel Andrews to-. lay to issue the State call. A thorough search of the history of the Re publican conventions has proved that the ex ecutive committee could find no justification for attempting to enforce the unit rule by the framing of its call. In the national convention MM a resolution, offered by Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, and amended by Mr. Butter worth, of Ohio, was adopted, providing. In part, that such methods or rules shall Include or secure to the several Congress districts in the United States the right to elect their own delegates to the national convention. Thi3, the amendment of Mr. Butterworth, was adepted only after a fierce contest, as its adoption re sulted .in the defeat of the third term candidacy of President Grant. Since that time there Baa been no action which could astj be con sSfued as relieving the party from thf aMlsjejasj cf that rule. It is. further pointed out that at the last meeting of the Republican National Committee a resolution was adopted instructing that the form of the call of 1900 b used In calling the convention of this year, and that, in Itself. would prevent any attempt materially to change it. These facts have been called to the atten tion of the doubters, and they express their willingness to abandon their former belief as to the occasion of the delay in the issue of the national call, but it Is evident thai they will feel relieved when the call .- actually issued. Quite apart from the reasons which have thus far delayed the issue of the call are these ad- Ceatlaueti m second pace. PRICE THREE CENTS. BRYAN BEHIND HEARST. BOOM WORRIES WIGWAM. Murphy Says He's Sot Committed, but Think Cleveland Can Win. William R. Hearst has a large sized political account to settle with Charles F. Murphy, leader cf Tammany Hall, .ml th. liquidation of the account is causing th Tmrrny men a great deal of - -,.. Th Democratic Na tional Committee men now in town Include Dan- M J. C-ampau. of Michigan. Norman E. Mack, of this State Troy Wood3on. of Kentucky J. G. Johnson, of Kansas, and Thomas Taggart. of Indiana. They practically admit to their friends that Hearst h.i 3 the backing of William J. Bryan, and that, while Mr r.ryan may not In sist on the nomination of Hearst for President, he drill insist on recognition for M- Hearst. The price which his opponents fear may be ex acted Is either the Vice-Presidentiol nomination or the nomination for Governor by the Murphy- Hill forces in this State. The way it is figured out Is that Messrs. Bryan and Hearst will have no difficulty in controlling 'at leapt -thM si the deiega It requires two-thirds to nominate. With the one-third the friends of Mr. Hearst can exact whatever twos arc thought to be satisfactory. It la understood that Mr. Hearat is in a receptive mood. If the way does not seem to be clear for 'tis nomina tion for President, he will try to accomplish the nomination of a Western man for President, and then he will make an effort for the Vlce- Presidentia nomination for himself. Rather than have things go that way, however, he would take the nomination for Governor, It is understood. Charles F. Murphy at Tammany Hall yester day said that he had not tied up with any one's boom. He met about a hundred politicians at Tammany Hall yesterday forenoon, and tried to make it clear to them that there would b. no mere patronage of any account until th Democrats of the State and nation turned th Republicans out of power. Then, his friends were assured, the federal and State Jobs would be sufficient in number to go around. I did not declare for anybody while I was la Washington. said Mr. Murphy. Reports that I did are Incorrect. I repeated a remark thaa I made seme time ago that If Cleveland ver nominated he certainly would be elected but t did not declare thru Tammany was for any on yet. We are resting Just now. It is too early to pick candidates. Did you say. as reported, that you were noe for Parker because he was a Hill man' Mr. Murphy was asked. I did not say that I was for or against Par ker, and I have no intention of committing my self at present. was the reply. Will New-York present a candidate In thai national convention I cannot say as yet. but I have no hesitation in saying that Mi State is surely in the Demo cratic column again. J. G. Johnson, chairman of the executive com ml tee of the Democratic Nations i Committee, at the Hoffman House yesterday said that the- Hearst boom was formidable in the West. -The sentiment in Kansas is strong for Mr. Ream Sid Mr. Johngcn. I have no doubt thru Kansas will send 4 solid delegation to St. I-ov3 . for M Hart. Nebraska also Is tor fc Harv, but tJv 4gru,vpn from that Snue la nut likely to.be fnrute Mr. Bryan vrUI ba deleate. and it would not do to Instruct him. It looks as If Hearst will pot the delegates from Illinois, too. Th- chief opposition to him will come from Chicago. The Hearst boom is a very serious proposition. I do not know tha Mr. Bryan will support Hearst, but I do know that Bryan will not stand for any man who did not earnestly and fervently support the candidates cf the Democratic party in 196 and again in lfMiV I was surprised at the strength of the Hearse boom among the Democratic National Commit tee tit its meeting in Washington this week. said Norman E. Mack, of Buffalo, last night to a Tribune reporter at the Waldorf- Astorin. I met a large number of very level headed fellows on the committee who said that their States seemed to be for Hearst. In fact, the strength, of Mr. Hearst's boom paralyzed me for a time it was so surprising. Will Mr. Brynn back Heaist Thru I cannot say. I think, continued Mr. Mack, that Mr. Bryan will be a very prominent figure in the convention. He has a very stron hold on the South and We. I think that ha will size up the temper of the convention and cordially indorse the prevailing sentimen, and afterward work for the nominees, whoever they may be. Mr. Mack called on Mayor McClellan nt tha City Hall yesterday. Mr. Mack's chances of staying on the national committee are much im proved on account of the turn affairs took as Washington. He is a close personal friend of Senator William J. Stone, of Missouri, and voted to have the convention in the Mound City largely for that reason. Mr. Mack's successor will not be elected until the convention gers through with its work He is trying to convinc the State leaders that It will be good Judgment to continue him on the committee. SATS BRYAX'S THE POWER Urejj Woodson Declares Ex-Candi date Will Dominate Convention. I'rey Woodson. member nf the Democrat National Committee from Kentucky, said last night at the Hoffman House that Bryan would dominate the next Democratic National Con vention, that he would dictate the platform. aad that, while he will not himself be a candi date for President, he will not all.iw the nom ination of any one antagonistic to him or telst views. Mr. Bryan will dominate the convention, be cause he will have a majority of the delegates with him. said Mr. Wocdson. Just what urn he will ha of his rower Is an intensely Inter esting thing to watch. The fact that Mr 1 and his friends will dominate the conva I ot be palatable news for my friends Blue Grass State, hut it is true nevertheless. X do not speak Inadvisedly when I make the pre diction. Many of you people here in New-York think that the western boundary of the United States is Jersey city. You forget Just what a national convention is in its scope. Wall Street is an In considerable part of the United States in the estimation of the men who make up the rank and file of the Democratic party Mr. Bryan holds to this view, and the majority of tir Democrats of this country are with him. I spent considerable time with Mr. Bryan in Washington this week. He U Just as popular with the Democratic masses as ever, and he hi the same Bryan. He will soon begin his cam paign of education. In fact, he began it last v -k and continued it last night when he spok In Indianapolis. I didn't see a Una of his speech in a New-York paper this morning, but I got a telegram from a gold bug friend of mn In Indianapolis, saying that the speech was on of the greatest ever heard there, and that th gold Democrats and silver men equally well pleased. Mr. Bryan already has mapped out a tour through Tennessee and Kentucky and Florida, and on his way back to Nebraska he will take in Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana. Mr. Bryan will not allow the Nebraska dele- famous TRAINS TO FLORIDA. N. Y. 4 Fla. Special. 210 P. M. Fa. West Indian Ltd.. 925 A. M. LnexeelleC service vt '-.. Atlantic Coast Una, Ufi. is tj-.

N't only ifi Mr. Bryan to be welcomed back after shnking hands with c-mierors and kings or. t v e other side, but his campaign mannra have skilfully prevailed on Charles K.

As soon .'i- Mr. Murphy awoke to a realization Of sat it meant, he suddenly re niemlered several traveling engagements that positively could not wait.

The statement la authorized that the conduct of Commander Dillingham, while following only general Instructions, li entirely indorsed and ap proved by the government, and it is believed that his intelligei handling of the situation will have a powerful influence toward the restora tion at order In the Island. The Washington goverrment earnestly hopes that order will come , tit of chaos In the island and a. Inn govern ment be established, under which Americana and other foreigners will receive adequate protection In future. It Is realized by the administration that the Dominican problem must be taken up and disposed of in a way that will put a stop to what was described by European ambassador to-npht as an Insufferable nuisance which the civilized world looks to the I'nited States to clean up.

Charles F. Murphy and Senator Patrick H. McCarren will. It was said laet night by one of their intimate friends In Tammany Hall, tell the Democratic National Committee in Washington nexi Tuesday that New -York State is solidly for ihe nomination of Chief Judge Alton B. Parker of the Court of Appeaia, for President. Senator McCarren will start for Washington on Sunday night. Mr. Murphy, according to the Present understanding, will see Chairman Jones and the other members of the committee on Sun day night Mr. Murphy Is expected in New- York on Monday. He left town on Tuesday niffht for Annsipolls. Washington and Atlantic City. If Meaara. Murphy and McCarren find the drift In the National Committee toward Parker. It is likely that Norman K. Mack, of Buffalo, will resign as the New-York member of the committee and be succeeded by Senator McCarren. and should the National Convention nominate Judge Parker. Senator McCarren will be chosen by him as chairman of the National Committee. It is not expected that Mr. Murphy, so far in advance of the meeting of the National Con vention, will make an open announcement that the .New- York State delegation will be for Judge Parker. In order to make the drift toward the judge oiill more marked, it will only be neces sary for Messrs. Murphy and McCarren to tell the members of the National Committee that every one In New-York want- Parker. There Feems to be a general sentiment in favor of a New- York man for the head of the ticket, and the Southern Senators seem to show a marked preference for Judge Parker. The race at the present time among Demo crats here seems to have narrowed to two men- Parker and Gorman. Senator Gorman's Intense racial prejudices, on which he made a winning campaign for his Benatorship, has put him at a great disadvantage with Judge Parker In the Northern States, according to Mr. Murphy's friends, and for that reason he Is a poor second at this time. In view of the developments last nic it. it la now believed that Judge Parker's aba nee from the McClellan dinner on Monday night, when his boom might have assumed undu prominence, was intentional, and that it was on the advice of Messrs. Murphy and McCfirren that he stayed away. The elevation of Senator McCarren, first to the National Committee and then, in case Judge Parker is nominated, to the head of the Na tional Committee, is a deal that is believed to OoaHawe on limit i SEVENTEEN DIE IN WRECK HE A DON COLLISION.

The train, which left Kansas City at 10 o'clock last night, was twenty minutes late. It carried many passengers for Oklahoma who had taken advantage of the homesteaders' excursion rates that closed yesterday. It also contained through sleepers and chair tars for San Francisco and Los Angeles. It is thought that carelessness of trainmen caused the wreck. The engineer and conductor weie instructed to mCt a stock train at Villa.rd, and, seeing that a train stood on the sidetrack there, Kenjamin. the engineer, threw open the throttle, and under full steam the train leaped into the darkness and crashed along at a rate which the passengers declare to have been fully sixty-live miles an hour. Meanwhile the stock train was hurrying to Willard to get on the siding and let the express pass. Its headlight suddenly appeared out of the darkness coming around a curve, and Ben jamin had only time to set his brakes before the two trains came together, and the cars of the express were piled in an Inextricable, mass, from Continued on Ufth pace.

A battalion has been sent from Vladi vostok to prevent the Japanese landing. There is no doubt that the Russian reply in timates in a friendly way that Russia cannot accept Japanese interference. The Russian government has approached the Wilson Line, asking what ships of the lin could be chartered in the Back Sea. RUSSIAN REPLY SEA RET. Delivered in Tokio Negotiations Not Yet Abandoned.

Japanese Statement of Points at Issue in Far East. Tokio, Jan. 6. A high Japanese authority to day made the following explanation of the status of the Far Eastern questiors The statement that Russia has made conces sions to Japan is not exact. On the contrary. Russia in the month of October made certain concessions, which were accepted by Japan, but subsequently withdrew them and assumed an attitude which left the Japanese little hope in the way of reaching a satisfactory agreement. The Japanese government, confident in the declarations of disinterestedness in Manchuria made by Russia, and recognizing Russia's spe cial interests in that region, wished to regulate, once for all, all questions in the Far East, in the interest of future peace and tranquillity. To this end Japan made the following proposals First Russia, and Japan should mutually respect the Independence and territorial integrity of China, and Corea. Second recognise reciprocally. Japan the- spe cial interests of Russia in Manchuria Russia, the special interests of Japan in Corea. Third enae mutually not to Infringe. Japan the commercial rights and immunities acquired by Russia in Corea Russia, the commercial rights and Immunities acquired by Japan in Manchuria. In making the third proposition Japan wished not only to protect her own rights in China and those of Russia in Corea, but to consecrate by the principle of equality of treatment the com mercial rights of all nations in Corea and China. Russia declined the Japanese propositions and submitted a counter proposition, which con tained a clause providing for the creation of a neutral zone extending trom the Chlnese-Corean frontier to Wong-Tan, on the east and to Ping Yang on the west. This zone comprised almost a third of Corea. This Russian pretension took from Japan all guarantee of the protection of her rights In Manchuria, and sequestrated a considerable On am mk mm LECI UTfll HEET v IAKER RE ELECT II Especial Interest in Governor ell's Message. st TTiETTmm to tan tmjbt.

POINTS IX MESSAGE. Almost without exception, interest in the Gov ernor's message submitted to-,iay centre. in th original and striking llMllhllhh .concern ing the financing of the v-ist rasa team The proposition, which outlined a method of aavtnr to the State 41.N.rt, was in itself sufficiently unique to command the admiration of Demo crats and Republicans, and the straightforward manner in whirl Governor Odell had com pletely developed his plan was the main theme of conversation about the Capitol. Of hardly secondary Interest was the truest ion of where the Governor proposed to raise the additional ...- . annually to carry out hi 3 plan, sinca his method was not outlined in the message. At rlrst the general Impression was that there would be another increase in excise taxes, but it was quickly developed that de prospect of any such legislation was ex jee..ingly slim. More over, the recommendations respecting the mort gage tax contained in the message also elimi nated this source of possible revenue. That tha Governor has told his friends that he has a plan In his pocket complete in every detail is cer tain, but what that plan is has not yet been divulged. That the raising of this sum, or at least the passage of legislation providing for this Increased revenue, is on the programme for the present session Is certain, for while th State treasury has in the surplus th 'J,Mt. needed for the first year, the general opinion Is that definite settling of the Question is de sirable. Queslora a tw constitutionality o j various phases of the Governor's i uH'ilMm tlona are, as he points out in the message, like ly to be raised, notably in the matter of th- loans by the counties, possibly, also in the case of the counties of greater New-York, as M the legal right to increase the county debt but these are questions that will be covered by legis lation before the necessity for the money actu ally arises. Within the next ten day Governor Odel will appoint the advisory board, to oc .rate with the State officials in solving tha tngteerica difficulties of the new project. EDUCATIONAL SITUATION. Next in Interest after th- canal recommenda tions contained In the Governor's message ,wa that relating la the public school situation. Hla proposition to divide the spheres of the Regents and th- Department of Public Instruction on the basis of primary and academic education was the subject of much favorable comment. Th- consensus of opinion was that the Governor had proposed a method final settlement of existing difficulties which was practicable and at the same time necessary. The Governor's reference to home rule was the topic of considerable argument. It was agreed that the Governor did not in his refer ence to the use of police for partisan purpose intimate that any State constabulary measure was i. be expected, for it is known that the de cision of the Court of Appeals in the case of the Albany police had practically declared State constabulary unconstitutional. That the Governor was in MM way touching on the excise situation was generally suspected it was. moreover, pointed out that he had previ ously suggested a referendum on the excise question to the State, however, and not to the citizens of greater New- York. That the Governor merely intended to call at tention to this question of vital importance ac the present moment is the general theory. Sim ilarly, the directing of the attention of the leg islature to the inequalities of til mortgage tax is interpreted as raising the question more to call the attention of the legislature to it han to prepare for any prearranged action. The Govern. has already recommended both the abolition of tr-.e mortgage tax and the sub stitution of two different tixes of record. Both, of these recemme iaiions wen without effect. Other subjects considered in the message were dlstussed. but the vast Importance of the canal project dwarfed all else, and whea the legis lature reconvenes this plan will he the subject of ICtspfSa fl comment, which was in some meas ure impossible to- lay, owing to the complexity of the Governor's plan, on which the legislature vie to study, rather than comment.

There Is reason to believe that bilis on the subject of taxation will be of Ices importance than in the last session, al though there are those who look for the reap pearanc of the mortgage tax measure in some form or slaw. But that the present session rill be known as a cral legislature, because of the extent and Importance of its canal legislation, srenu en tirely probable. Of thi magnitude and Impor tance f this branch of legislation some Idea may be pained srbSS it Is real'.zea that In one singlj phase s easuTSS are contemplated rovld ng- for the caving of HftjOOfltflftfli In explaining his ita sons tor a-ttaching so much uutfSVtaac to the prescii. Bfsja, Governor Odel declared that OTSS contemplating this caving wou be introduced, and H Is expected on ail sidts that this saving will be made through the canal bonds, over fIOQUQOO of which are to be Issued to cover the expense of he cana.l. T'Vu fllfferent methods aimed to accomplish this sr lng have been Coracaatsd, the one providing for the issue of short term bonds for twenty years instead of iong term bonds for fifty, years, tad It fcas been ligured that if by Indirect taxation the car.al could be paid for in- that time, 40,OJO,lXXJ In lmereFt would be saved over the fifty year plan. Still anoiher method which may appear is that of securing for the State the taking up of fSdUu at the bonds without Interest by the counties. This latur an is generally regarded as unlikely, because of the heavy burden it lays on the counties and the possibility that it mig-ht prove unconstitutional. PROPERTY FOR NEW CANAL BOOTS. Another important, piece of canal legislation that is expected is a bill authorizing the ap pointment ty the Governor, of a. board of appraisers to view the property .-which will DS taien by the new route of the -canal, and in some nwsnrr. at least, to avoid a long and exreni condemna-ticn proceeding tollowlng the taking of the land by the State. A bill Is e.iFo expected providing lor a long term for tha members of the advisory r.oard. whom the Gov ernor will npi oim. as directed by the canal law, to assist th State Bogtoear axid Purveyor in ii termir.inc the various engineering questions .it tending the construction of the canal. The Gov ernor Brill not appoint the members of this board unti the session convenes. Still another important phase of .a egliiUni Is that governing the roriL. of labor. The present legislators iriH In a proh ebility be asked to enacr laws providing that worknen on the ani shall he paid the prevail- Insj rate .f smss 1 , that the eight hour law Fhali t- enr,rrc-cj an.l that only citizens shall l employed. In addition tr these general meas ures i.ere will probably be endless locaJ Mils affecting the disposition of the pres ent canal bd in various cities and towr.a alone its route. For exait'ipl, the people of Fyrs ie favor a measure that will permit the eaent canal bottom to be used as a rail raj lire, the tracks which now frogs the . at the street level being depressed to the l-vei of the anal t.ed. thus avoiding many grade crossings. But while, it appeare that much im joriant KiUt.. growing out of the new canai v.ili arise, thre is also a decided mj r-ssioi that there srUl be a marked diminution In the num ber of measure passed, if rot Of those intro duced, providing for tMW bridges and t rove rner.ts of rarjo sons -r. the -.--tiit car.al lines.

Ai the last n.tetir.jr of this committee, on December 22, it was reported that the mem bers had cred upon t tie general character f the legislation oer try to provide for this harmonizing, and had Instructed Senator Ste vens to draw up a bill bodying their ideas and preseni it at their next meeting, which will take place In New-York City on January 7. At tbe time of this last meeting it was also intlmaJ that the general plan of tli commit tee would be to provide a third edU' ationa di vision in the form of a commission composed of thre members, the majority and minority represented In the two branches of th legis lature each to elect on member of the com mission, and the Kgents to Relect the third.

If true, give additional weight to whatever measure Is Introduced ps a result of this comn It Thtre is little rc-spect at present of the pas sage of any meadure interfering with the pres ent franchise tax law.

NelidofT. and the Japanese Minister, M. Montono. were among the listeners to the President's re marks, and consequently the report that Russia had decided not to grant Japan's proposals was somewhat inexplicable at the Japanese Legation. To-nisht Minister Montono received a number of his countrymen and officials. The entrance of the legation was decorated with large Japan ese flags. When asked regarding the utter ances of Baron Hayashi. Minister Montono said that certainly no such report emanated from him. and that he was the usual medium for ad vices of that character to his colleague In Lon don. He remarked that, on the contrary, the day had passed without advices having been re ceived, and that the status of the situation con tinued to be the awaiting of Russia's reply. When asked for his views on the outlook for the maintenance of peace. Minister Montono asked to be excused from replying, saying that the situation was too delicate to permit him to express hi 3 views on possible results. It is said In a well informed quarter here that France would have no right officially to commu nicate Russia's reply to Japan, and it is added that the reply has not yet been framed and that It Is expected it will be prf.yer.ted to the Japan ese government through Baron d. Rosen, the Russian Minister at Tokio. At the same time it has been known here for the last few days that Russia's attitude has been changing, as a result of the bellicose policy which Japan is pursuing, and that Russia 13 disinclined to make the concessions which would have been possible, it is asserted, had Japan adopted a more conciliatory course. It is reiterated that If there Is any breaking off of relations Japan, not Russia, wiil take the Initial step. The Information of the Japanese Minister in London, therefore, is In lino gener ally with that which the diplomatic corps here has been in possession of or several days. What is regarded here us a significant ex change of telegrams occurred to-day between Genera Konropatktn. the Russian War Minis ter, and Genera Andri. the French Minister of War. The Russian Minister telegraphed to Gen tral Andre' bis wishes for the happiness and prosperity of himself and the French army for the new year, in reply General Alr-o referred to the friendship whkh united the two armies. and which strikingly shows it.s.'if in all clr cumstances. and concluded with extending cor uiul wishes for the prosperity and greatness of the Russian army.

WARSHIPS Rumors at Colon of the General Pinzon'3 Destruction. Colon, Jan. 1. There were persistent rumors here yesterday, and again to-day, that the Co lombian gunboat General Plnzon had been sunk by American warships. Thers Is no confirma tion of the report. The Mayflower, to which Admiral Cojhlan transferred his flag yesterday, steamed out of the harbor this morning. There are now no ships el war here. It is r..-t known here whether the Indian chief Inanniulr.a left his territory of his own accord, or as forced to do so by the Colombians. Much .mc is attached to that point. Th cruis er O'.yn.pia and the gunboat Castine have not returned fmm the direction ' Cartl, where they went to invest. gate the situation. Washington. Jan. 1.

PANAMA REPORTS QUIET. Xo Signs of Colombian Activity Xicaraguan Recognition. Panama. Jan. I. The situation on this side of the Isthmus Is quiet and satisfactory to the naval authorities. Reports from Darien up to last night give no evidence of Colombian activ ity or the presence of Colombians in Panaman territory. Darien miners who cams here a fort night ago have returned there to resume work. The thirty American marines and bluejackets who remain at Yaviza have artillery and two armed launches with which they are patrolling the rivers. Panaman soldiers continue scouting from Yavtxa through the Darien district. The I'r.od States cruiser Boston is in San Miguel Hay supporting the Yaviza outpost. The Wyo ming is having target practice, and th Concord and Marblehead are both at Panama. The Yaviza and Real Banta Maria outposts were materially reduced because there was no nc essity to keep large forces there. They are simply observation outposts and thirty men cun do the work. Persona best Informed concerning the military situation along the Darien frontier do not ex pect any Colombian aggression for the present. ThSB are of the opinion that the situation Is likely to remain as It is at present until the canal treaty is approved by the Congress of the United States, or until General Reyes re turns Cross. Washington. This opinion pre.ails. nuthwiihstanding reports of concentration of Colombian troops at Barranqua and the fact that Colombia doubtless is moving troops tow- vxd the Atrato River. The disturbed internal conditions of Colom bia are thought to give a suriicient reason for these movements of Colombian troops, but the naval authorities are in nowise remitting their activity. President Zelaya of Nicaragua sent a dis patch to the Junta this morning, saying thai It pave him pleasure to recognize Panama on the New-Year's Day. The recognition by Nica ragua has caused much satisfaction. EXPECTS PARKER AT DINNER. Homeseekers Tickets 1 West and Northwest Low round-trip rates to points in Wisconsin.

Beaobraioff, who has been rlansnri -.. the power behind the scenes In the Russo-Jurax.ese negotiations, for Switzerland may be construed as an Indication that the In- Jice of the Russian war party is waning. This view is strengthened by the failure to hold any meeting of the Committee on the Far Kist. Such a meeting Is considered unlikely while th Question of war or peace Is In the balance.

It is this currency which has brought Colombia to the lowest u-vei of financial despair, absolutely destroying her credit, eliminating UM possibility of ii'-r paying her mrtohteriness, and prompting tho enactment of a law rujulriijj uK custom dues to be paid In sold after January 1. The folly dis played by Colombia In rejecting the canal treaty, which would htm given her no.esejQQ In sold and afforded her an opportunity to retire the worthless paper and estshllsh something tike a decent mone tary ay stem. Is realized whan theao facia uTw known. MNKvy MONET OF PANAMA. But, Interesting as they are, these farts only slightly concern Panama. They explain, in a nc.u ure. why Colombia was always so bsMuouh In at taching th public ' .'- In the Department of Panama but otherwise the isthmus never uurTi-red because of the worthlessness of the paper mnwy of Colombia. The region lit that Panama years ntco l' tnandi -i and her commercial requirements, due to translsthmian traffic, such that Co lombia had to tram Urn i and th Issuance of a silver currency f r local use. This silver now constitutes the money ox th new republic. Locally It Is known km tin or monkey money. Why Beoaose It la a mixture of cheap alloy with a very little silver, the portion of sliver being BO small that the rota of exchange for Aniur loan gold fluctuates between Z 6 and 12 70 fur L That means that for 11 of American gold or.o re ceives an amount In Colombian sliver om hi between the umi named. Hre. ufc'aln. trloks ar played with the money, for there Is no Mxl rat of ejrhajigo, and tho two banking houses on the Isthmus vary th rate from day to day. and mold v. oomfottaUa Bum by raising or depressing thi x otuLiiK. The unit of value In thin coinage In th BU-cejit piece, worth ordinarily about 16 cams In Arlcan money, and a mor unsatisfactory cur rency It would be difficult to discover. When ehangmg a small koM plej on gts sev eral pounds of silver In return, each piece varying with the date and place of the minting. In this roapeot there Is little uniformity, for the money la coined 6omtlmo In New-York, sometlmea In I'hlla delphla. and at othor times In Europon cltleH, Just as the holders of the money coining concession find It advantageoua to place thj contract. iioine of It la milled, and some has the Colombian motto, Llbertad tiod, Ufa and Liberty sunk In binajl letters about its edges. Occasionally one receives ponderous pieces the dollars of Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa lica all of which are current and again one get the regular Colombian 60-cent pieces defaced with a amall stamp, showing that at some time or other that par ticular piece found Its way Into Costa Rica, and was stamped on with the obverse and reverse of the Costa Kican coat of arras, a process by which Colombian silver la made current In that country. NEED OK FIXED BASia As iray be Imagined, this currency luads to end less complications. It Is, in fact, almost necessary for a man to keep a set of book on himself If he would know where he. stands. More is a case In point Just Wfor nailing from New-York I changed a sura of money Into English gold sovereigns,, as I was advised that English gold only wua accepted on the Isthmus. It was a foolish thing to do, as American gold and American banknotes are more valuable hero and better liked than is the inonuy of England, but in my Ignorance l did the foolish thing, paying 4 8S for each English sovereign. Upon arrival at Colon I wished to Koiul a i able dis patch to the States. Tho cable toll was 10 85 Colom bian sliver. 1 laid down an English sovereign, which waj accepted at 11 Colombian, so that I bad la cents change due me, and for this amount I got an American live-cent piece and a copper cent. Sev eral persona endeavored to tell me how much the cable cost in American money, but none have succeeded. 1 leave it with the rtaiior us an cx ami.li of the Intricacies of this monetary system, which, most conimeiidably. Panama hopes soon to abandon for ihe gold basis. Whether Panama wUlbe able to realise upon this expectation Is another problem There an abso lutely no statistics available showing exactly, or even approximately, the amount of this stiver money In circulation on the Isthmus. Colombia never hud any Interest in the matter, as the circu lation of this sliver waa confined to this depart ment nor was the money Itself liked by olombia, which always regretted the fact that the commer cial requirements of this particular Btate prevented her from foisting upon It her own worthless paper. She never made any effort, therefore, to keep Statistics, and while It Is believed that there Is something Ilka Jl.ftOu. of the silver In existence, nothing definite Is known on this point. It Is. however, the purpose of the republic, as explained by nor Manuel K. Amador. Minister of Finance, and indorsed by the Junta, to retire all of this as soon as possible. For this purpose it Is proposed to use a much of the 110,. gold to be paid by the United States for the canal concession as may be required. The plan as far as It has been outlined is to deposit the necessary gold In the public treasury as a guarantee fund, and then issue a paper cur rency, redeemable in gold, and by proper legisla tion fix a rate of exchange us between gold or the gold secured paper and silver. Should this plan Be adopted th rate of exchange will probably he fixed at tl gold for 2 silver, and silver dollars and half dollars one received at the treasury will not be reissued, exofpt when received In the form of an intrinsically valuable subsliiary currency. SOUND MONEY SCHEiIE. . Much difficulty is, however, expected before this Diari can tie put Into operation. All l'tuuirt avoid Colombian papor as It would th plague. Nobody on the isthmus will handle the worthless stuff. Silver has been so long in use that no other money, except gold, is known, the Ignorance of any other being so extensive that among the natives Amer ican nickels and coppers are refused when offered. The officials all realise that II will be a long and tedious task to educate the people to understand thai a paper currency, secured by a public deposit i gold i.s worth its face value. To overcome this national prejudice against paper will be the great est difficulty in the way of acceptance of the plan. yr the Panamans ar counting with absolute con naenoa upon the ratification of the canal treaty ami the early payment to them of the ..-- In American gold. This matter of converting the currency system from a depreciated and varying silver basis to the gold standard is. however, the smaller horn of the financial dilemma confronting Panama. Under the old regime the revenues for thia department are supposed to have aggregated about 1500. annually ibis amount may not be exact, at the statistics are very faulty. Half a million la given, however. us a safe estimate for purposes of calculation These revenues are derived from several sources, and were supposed to be of two classes- one for th national and the other for the departmental ex chequer. Colombia managed very successfully to gobble all of it. but the nctlonary division is still used In the bookkeeping. The national share earns from an import tax on alcoholic liquors, from a nominal tax on real estate, and from the- sale of certain of the concessions that have proved such a bane to the isthmus. The departmental revenues were variously derived from a tax on the produc tion of alcoholic liquors, from a nominal license assessed against saloons, and from the sale of certain other concessions. The amount named und the sources from which It was derived do not Include the sum of 250.066 gold annually paid by the canal company for its concession. of this amount ' 5. gold was supposed to go to the Department of Panama, although the whole sum was always taken by the government of Bogota. Upon this amount It Is useless to figure, as during on i of her bankrupt moments, many years ago, Colombia went to the usurers and discounted th.s icesm fee for a ten of years which will not expire until nine years hence so that until ulz Panama cannot count upon receiving any revenue from the canal concession by way of rental pay ments. THE REVENUES MUST SHRINK. Thin Introduces the most serious difficulty before Urn new republic. By the terms of the treaty with Panama the United States does not begin to pay the KSO.OSO annual rental for the canal aon until th year 1913. Under the same agreement Colon and Panama, tha only ports at which there la any custom hou business of consequence, are mad. to al tents and purposes, tree for th entry of merchandise of all classes. Now. Befior Amador, Minister of Finance who was departmental treasurer during the Colombian dominion, estimates that threM-fifthfi, or 1900. of all the revenues, national and departmental, were derived from the customs duties. This sum will by the provisions of the treaty with th United States. exists to bo collected, and the revenues of the new republic will, In consequence, be cut down to ... thing like 1300. sliver annually. Figure us they will and they are, figuring hard and very closely the officials of the new republic cannot discover how it will be possible for them to conduct the government or. a sum under 5- silver a year. To bring the expenses within that sum the army U to be reduced to mere nothing ness the navy li to b permitted to lapse Into an almost visionary state, and oth.-lai salaries ar to be fixed at tii- lowest limit conslHtent with good service and th preservation of satisfaction and contentment In nttlt al circles. With ail of this Panama looks a deficit of about 53U0. a year squarely In the face. Under these circumstances. It la not difficult to understand the desperation of her Immediate financial prospects The situation may be eased slightly by Increasing UM tax on Halooni and on the production of iilcohollo liquors, and by more rigid enforceme. t of the law in such respects, though It is impossible to hope fir much from this source. Th saloons here are h.i poverty stricken as arf the people while the only liquors produced are what i 9 known as chics, the native , and a native whlta rum. fairly good In quality, but by force of ctr ciMiiHtHncea small In quantity and marketed at an extremely low figure. The Imposition of a tax on personal property would avail nothing, as, asld from a very few people, the Panamans have no property worth assessing nor Is It possible to add very much to the revenues by Increasing th tax on real estate, for to tax It much heavier than at prent would be to tax It out of the hands of It owners. After explaining all of these facts and producing ample proofs for their statements, the official of th government will very frankly admit that they art In a quandary. It would be Impossible, of ooursi, for them to pay expenses out of th prin cipal payment for the. canal concessions until th payment of the annual rental enriches the puhlla treasury but thl they are loath to do. They are too long headed In a business way to deplete the only a.set they have, or are ever likely to have. It would, too, be possible for them to float a loan after tho establishment of the regular government but that Idea la not looked upon with favor for a loan would only Increase th annual charge against the government, and sooner or later tho principal would have to be paid. To relieve her condition and extricate herself from this financial dilemma It la absolutely neces sary for Panama to have JiOOft,to. or thereabouts of the canal concession fee put out at Interest. It Is her only hope. This sum. If placed at 4 per cent, would, even after the republic goes to a gold basis, afford It revenues ample for all t legiti mate requirements. The Investment must be with th United States end so secured by convention that the principal carl never be. levied upon by the republic. Just now the United States Is In the highest favor on the Isthmus. It would materially Increase the respect In which she Is held, besides strengthening her con trol and easing her solution of the police and other problems appertaining to dominion over tha canal lone, If she should meet Panama half way in this matter. By making herself the custodian of ejght tnnths of the canal concession fee she would ease the financial strain upon the new republic, and, while keeping S,mi In her pocket, Incur no obligation except for the annual payment of a reasonable interest.

The Weather Bureau said it wasn't a bliz zard in the strict, technical sense of the term,' but the public in general, not being a sCa.Maw for the etiquette surrounding polito weather expressions, called it a blizzard. Six inches of snow underfoot, a sky full overhead, a tempera ture of 10 degrees above zero and the -wind Mowinsr thirty-four miiea au hour were suffi cient to justify the expression. Commuter who stamped on ferryboat decks as the pilots felt their way cautiously in tha harbor, peopl on trains that were anywhere from one to two hours late, as were those on almost every railroad running into the city, peugers in blocked and snail-paced surface cars, team sters r.-ho tried to hold up slipping. steaminaT horses, pedestrians who slipped and atumbls and measured their lengths en the sliiewsJk these told one another it was a blizzard. Early in the morning the snow began fanirur ani the wind rising, and as the hours advanced the snowrlakes srrew larger and cn down faster, and the wind, not to be outdone, waxaU stronger with each gust. The light of a gray day dawned on a perfect blizzard aetting Long lines of deformed, hunchbacked peonl ploughed the smooth surface of the snow ht into myriad tracks, as they waaded their way to the elevated stations. With ths beglnnlnT of trafflc began the trials of man and teast. Panting horses, struggling In vain, went down by ths hundreds. Some lay in the snow untn a bullet ended their sufferings. Others. wttb the aid of blankets and cuss words, scrai bled to their feet and again essayed to haul their heavy loads. Men and women, too, found preserving balance and foothold a difficult task, and many was the liniment bottle laat nlgbs. that made frequent trips to the drug store. As the day wore on the temperature dropped steadily, and surface trafflc began to feel the clogs on its wheel. The elevated roads did not suffer, for the snow, dry and scattered by th wind, did not pack close on rhe third rail. ant what did gather there was scraped oft by th new scrapers. What, however, was a blessln to the elevated roads was a curse to the electnr cars, for the snow blown from the eleva I structure and along the street piled up ii mounds in spot, forcing the cars to back, ar.tl ram the obstacle again and again. The bUe revolving brush ploughs buzzed their way over the lines continuously, spurting snow clou-i- rntu the gutters, but they were not equal to main taining conditions that would allow more tha a speaking acquaintance with the time schedule. In the afternoon people who gathered at the railroad stations to greet Incoming friend learned that trains from all points up th- State were from one to two hours' late.

IfasMnStflO, Jan. 13. Democrats in the Senate end House are beginning to realize that a grave ioiiticai error was made by their national com titiee in selecting St. Louis as the conventio i city. The kalection of the city Itself is not . trreatly resetted, aside from the personal dis comforts which it is feared will be experienced ty those attending, but the motive of prompting it ts held to be open to eerious criticism. As announced in The Tribune this morning, the followers of Bfnafnr norr.an end other can flBtes. fearing a stampede for William R. HearEt, should the convention go to Chicago, rorireu energetically to secure the vote neces sary to name St. Louis. In this they were sue- . ftse.'ul, but they failed to take Into considera tion ha eober second thought of the Democracy Vlileh is now distinctly antagonistic to the deal. Prominent Democrats in Washington, while they fcold that it would be obviously improper to permit their names to be quoted, do not hesi tate to declare that the action of the Democratic Kational Committee yesterday brought about khe very result It was sought to avoid. They assert that it materially benefited the candidacy or Mr. Hearst, by giving it an importance not hitherto accorded It. They point out that the jcomtry lias receive the impression that the Democratic party is afraid of Mr. Hearst, and Ban away from a city supposed to be favorable to his ambitions-. The action of the commit tee has produced a feeling of annoyance and feser.tinern on the part of the Democrats in rwashingtor. for they believe that the party has been placed in a false and ridiculous attitude through an -advised movement, and one cal culated to widen the breach between the Bryan jaad anti- Bryan factions. The leaders of the Democracy brought .along 'With them to the committee meeting a large '.consignment of harmony. It-was conspicuous fly labelled and extensively advertised as a cure -all for Democratic Ills, and not a few were ''gold bricked Into partaking liberally of the '.remedy. After the announcement of the vote jfor the convention city and en enlightenment as 'to motives which led up to the selection, the harmony label was removed and one bearing ,the name Discord was substituted. The rush of customers for this article soon disposed of the entire stock, and a fresh supply was Im .mediately ordered to be be delivered nt Ft. Louis on July 6. The sincerity cf the New-York Democrats in advocating the nomination of Judge Parker for iPresident is to-day seriously doubted by the I party leaders in Washington, as the impression pains headway that the astute New-Yorkers are rot so guileless as they appear, and may be 'preparing a coup that will upset all calculations. Southern and Western Democrats are becoming Restless, and even resentful, adding materially jto the all-pervading spirit of harmony ' la Democratic ranks. National Commltteemen Clayton, of Alabama, is one of those v.ho doubt the elncerlty of ths j Parker boon, and he Is not afraid to express his Incredulity. He said to-day that New-York wan not sincere in it. advocacy of Judge Parker's nomination. He was inclined to the belief that the w- Yorkers were putting- forward Judge Parker as the candidate of the lmirf Stat9 iprrndpally for the purpose of shutting out some other X -1 -k boon which mirht possibly be brought to the front. Another .Mure- of the after convention pro rip was the statement that Charles F. Murphy, leader of Tammany Ball, and his lieutenant. Mr. McCarren, are at odds over the Parker jboom. It is said that Mr. Murphy Is not favora- Ible to Judjre Parker. Tbere was some talk that 'Mr. Murphy still entertained a Itnseriais hope ,that Mr. Cleveland might ho induced to run, and it is raid with some pFtivenPS that in such an CVeill Mr. Murphy would thro-,-.- all the weight of 'his Influence to Mr. Cleveland, and take the chances of the Bryan element putting its veto on the movement. BRYAN MEN ANGRY. 'Object lo St. Louis Why Crim mins Didn'l Go to Capital. 'LABOR MEN TO NAME HEARST. John D. Crimmir did not head the delegation of bsjateeas men that went to Washington to ret the Democratic National Convention for New- York because he knew that Charles F. Murphy was opposed to it. When this fact was fuinour.ceJ in the newspapers inst reek. Mr. 1 Murphy rushed into print with a statement that he -seas in favor of the convention coming to New- York. Mr. Crimmins knew better oil the while, at.d it was because Mr. Murphy would not say that he was in favor of having the con tention come here that Mr. Crimmins refrained from going to Washington to talk In behalf of a 'thing that ths Tammany leader had ordered his friends secretly to oppose. Mr. Crimmins will ear on January 19 on a Mediterranean trip. He had no time to waste on a fake crusading trip to Washington. The Bel' loi of St. Loiis Is looked upon by locai Democrats as a victory for the Gorman nTrfjsan Mniphj r-onblnitc.n over the Bryan n.en. and as sucn it Is regarded by Tammany I a victory for the friends of Chief Judge l'arker of this State. Ex-Mayor Van Wyck and the Democratic Club delegation returned from Washington yes terday. They admitted that the Bryan men seemed pretty sore over the selection of St. Louis.

All to Quit if Power House Men, Non-Union, Work. Another subway tieup Is threatened unless by noon to-day non-union men employed by firms outside of New-York to put In the equip ment at the West Flfty-nlnth-st. power house of the company are discharged. There are five or six of these firms, the largest of which Is the Alis-Chalmer3 company, of Cleveland, which fought the last general strike of the Interna tional Association of Machinists throughout the country for the rine-hour workday for over a year. Since then It has employed non-union mn. There has been a great deal of feellnj among the unions of BkilleJ trades for some time at this power house over the employment of these non-union men. It culminate,, it was stated yesterday, by the unions in nearly a dozen skilled trades whose members are employed at the power house informing the com raptors for the subway who employed their members that If the non-union men were not discharged before noon to-day work rt the power house would he tied up and the strike extended to all the subway. Previous to this there was a strike by fifty union tile layers employed by the Manhattan Glass Tile Company in the subway station at Elghteenth-st. and Fourth-aye. against the em ployment of four non-union men. President S. B. Dcwsnap Of the company said that tha strike was a. violation of the arbitration agree ment of the Building Trades Employers' Asso ciation, of which the company Is a member, end which the Tile Layers' Union had signed. At the Building Trades Club it was stated that M Milken Brothers are the only members of the Employers' Association who are doing work .t the Fifty-ninth-st. power house, where they em ploy members of the new housesmiths' organi zation. It was stated on behalf of th firm that It expected its employes to observe the arbi tration agreement and refrain from striking. Word of the ultimatum of the skilled trades to-day reached the Building Trades Club, but no ore would discuss it. A good deal of the work along the subway is completed, and altogether the strike programme. if it is carried on, will involve about three thousand men. The contractors are In a hurry to get the subway completed, and any delay, however short. Is looked on as a serious thing at present. The strike would be a violation of the agreement between the Central Federated Union and the Rapid Transit Contractors' Asso ciation. By this agreement, before anything else is done, all differences and disputes are referred to a Joint arbitration board of subway contrac tors and the Central Federated Union Rapid Transit Committee, of which John J. Pallas is president until his successor is appointed. John 13. McDonald, general contractor for tho subway, said that -no complaints had been made to him, and he had not been oclally informed of any Impending trouble. President Dewsnap of the Manhattan Glass Tile Company said the four iron union men were specialists, who showed the tile layers how to use a patent cement the company adopted. Ho granted all other demands, and explained to William H. Farley, business agent of the tile layers before the strike, that these men had no union. At the last meeting of the arbitration board of the Employers' Association, which Farley attended, he failed to mention this strike. A CUBAN TARIFF DILL.

The House disposed of the tariff question to-day by passing a bill au thorizes President Palma to Increase duties in his Judgment, not to exceed 30 per cent more than the present rates.

TOO FUDDLED TO TRY CASK BECHTEL TRIALS HALTED. Judge Stops District Attorney The Second Acquittal. BT TEI-CGRAPn TO TIIE TRIBUNE. Allf-ntown, Perm.. Jan. 13. Owing to the condition of District Attorney E. J. LJchtenwalner. thero was an abrupt adjournment this afternoon in the Bechtel murder trial after Alois Eckstein, one of the suitors of the murdered girl, had been acquitted of complicity in the crime. L.lchtenwalner was so befuddled that it was with difficulty tnat the case was carried to a conclusion, and the shabby old courtroom was the scene of the. wellntgh un precedented spectacle of a District Attorney, after hearing his own witnesses and calling several of those originally putrmonfd by the other side, ask ing for a verdict of not guilty. In the words of Judge Trexler from me bench, the prosecuting at torney had succeeded in establishing an alibi for the defence. Several times the court interfered and threatened to end the proceedings for the day unless the Commonwealth conducted its case in a more order ly manner. At one time the District Attorney's assistant took charge, only to be set aside by his Chief later. The proceedings were endured until after the Jury had been Instructed to render a ver dict of acquittal, when Judge Trexler adjourned the court. The cause of the trouble wa unfortunately pat ent enough when court convened after the noon recess. Mr Lichtcr.walner had returned to court in a condition Which It Is kindest to believe was the result of Ffim.' natural indisposition, and from that moment his com went pieces. His voice was thick, and his manner abstracted. Ho would sem to fortcet asking a question, and would repeat It to weariness. His queries were atsurd. and at last his inability properly to manage matters be cam so painfully apparent that Judge Trexler declared If the Commonwealth does not con duct it case in an orderly manner I shall adourn court until to-morrow. The District Attorney wanted to go ahead with the trial of the accused members of the Bechtel family, but. tb attorney for tin BechteU pro. tested emphatically. The District Attorney, how ever, was insistent, and ordered the names of the defendants called, but the Judge interrupted, say- Ing to the District Attorney I- you Intend to conduct the prosecution your self or will ou rely on assistant counsel If the latter, the trial will ko on, otherwise th court will adjourn until to-awrrow morning. The District Attorney proposes to conduct this cao himself, Llehtenwalner was understood to reply. Then thin court stands adjourned until 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, ordered the Jodfa, Before court opened to-day the District Attorney admitted that h had a weak case against Eck stein, and did not expert to convict hire. His hope was that something might develop in the examina tion that would lead to a clew to the real murderer or murderers. Tho opening address of Mr. Lutz, who is assisting thn District Attorney, was exceed ingly brief, and did not indicate that the Common wealth expected to fasten complicity in th mur der on Eckstein. Eight witnesses were called, but the only point brought out was that Eckstein and the girl frequently quarrelled, and that Eckstein Is alleged to have said to her You are trying to drive me to the grave, but you may get there before me. This testimony was given by Mrs. Brobst. the dead girl's clutor. who said that she overheard the remark about Easter last year. David Welnenberger, who was acquitted yester day of complicity In the crime, refused to answer many questions put to him with reference to ins re lations with tho cirl. The examination of the last two witnesses called was prolonged beyond all reasonable time. In fact, at one time It looked aw though the District Attor ney wns tryinK the CAM for the defence, und Judge Trexler interrupted him. saying 'Are you trying to establish un alibi for the de fondunt Finally the District Attorney announced that tho Commonwealth had no more witnesses to examine, and was therefor- compelled to ask that the de fendant be discharged. Judge Trexler Instructed the Jury accordingly, and, without leaving their seats, they rendered a verdict of not guilty. The attempt to continue the cases and the ad journment of the court in consequence of the Dis trict Attorney's action followed. STRIKE ON STEEL TRUST. Coal Miners Ordered Out Cut in Pay the Cause.

ARBITRATION IN FAR EAST TRIBUNES SUGGESTION. Public Opinion in France Favors Such a Solution. Social to The New-York Tribune by Frasb Cable. Copyright. 19o4 By The Tribune Association. Paris, Jan. 13. The suggestion of The New- York Tribune to refer the Ru3so-Jap' sst WaV culty to the Hague Tribunal has been widely re produced. In the Temps. the Journal dcs Dbats. the Libert, the Matin. the Fi gar. the Gau'.Ms. Gil Bias. the Journal. the Petit Jourr-il and in the leading papers of the departments the idea, on the whole, comes as a welcome solution in the present pacific tendency of th Gallic spirit, for everywhere, except among a few redhot Nationalists, any notion of France being drawn into active intervention is dreaded as an awful calamity. Nevertheless, moderate patriotic organs, such a the Temps and the Journal dcs Debnta refrain from urg ing France's great and beloved ally, the Emperor of Russia, to take the initiative, and The Trib une's suggestion, is published without comment. The true gist of French opinion is set forth in the conversation I had to-day with the French apostle of arbitration and the French delegate to th Hague Tribunal, Baron d'Estournelles de Constant. Deputy of the Sarthe, who made the following statement We must not expect too much from the Hague Court. Its creation is still recent, and yet last year and the year before all the European pow ers, France included, were more or less hostile lo the court and tried to boycott it. It Is only the prudent initiative of the United States that has saved the Hague Court from that tacit hostile coalition, but President Roosevelt, in do ing so when ha sent before the court the case of the Pious Fund of California, took great care to choose that case among the small and merely financial foreign difficulties of his government. He would never have begun with a big polittcal affair, and if another government had advised him to follow a different line he would have certainly refused to li.-ten to it. It is the same with Russia. . for Russia un doubtedly considers her difference with Japan a3 a national one. and that is why I think it would be useless to advise her to brlJr.K it before th Hague Court, but if Russia is. not prepared to go to The Hasrue she cannot forget the Hague Convention, which may give to her, as well as to Japan, important facilities, for the settlement of their conflict. For instar - e. it has been de cided by Article thav every civilized power is morally bound to offer her bons offices. Very likely England has already offered her bons of fices to Japan, and it may be that France, In accordance with the universal pacific feeling of opinion, has tendered the same to her ally. Rus sia. I am afraid nothing more can be done now. Let us lgin, as President Roosevelt has done, with small cases. As fur the great questions, let us try to settle them with th resources of the bons offices. Adrier. Hobmrl. E.litorof the Temps. when consulted on the subject, declined to express an opinion, considering the matter, In view of the French alliance with Russia, too delicate for France to take the initiative In such a proposal. M. Perivler. Editor of Cril Bias, approved generally The Tribune's suggestion, but ex pressed confidence that war would be averted. and deprecated the manoeuvres of Stock Ex change speculators, who seemed to be using all their efforts to precipitate a conflict. Senator Saint-Germain, when asked for hi 3 views on the subject, said It would be a splendid thins if the Hague Tribunal should give a pacific solution of the Russo-Japanese difference. The Emperor of Russia has astinied the title of Emperor of Peace, and utilizing the Hagne Tribunal would be an excellent opportunity to Justify such a title. If Nicholas II would only manifest a de sire to refer the dispute to The Hague Japan would be compelled to submit to such arbitra tion, and this would terminate the matter peace fully. Otherwise the dispute may have far reaching consequences. Firm confidence prevails here that the dis pute betwee.i Russia and Japan will be settled amicably by giving Japan predominance in Corea and by Russia observing the. open door treaties In Manchuria. C. I. B. RUSSIA'S TURN TO REPLY. Japan's Response Made Xo Time Limit Set for Answer. London, Jan. 13. A dispatch from Tokio to Reuters Telegram Company says that Japan's answer to the last Russian note was handed this afternoon to Baron de Rosen, the Russian Mins ter, and that negotiations will be continued without any time limit being setifor their ter mination. It is stated In Toklo that Japan has never asked for the evacuation of Manchuria, but frankly recognizes Russia's special Interests there and her right to protect' them. Japan only demanded the realization of Russia's voluntary pledges respecting China's territorial Integrity in Manchuria and the freedom of residential rights and international trade there. Another dispatch from Toklo says the min isters who attended the recent conferences for the consideration of the reply to the Russian note assert that the attitude. Japan ha 3 taken is remarkably conciliatory. The Foreign Office state 3 that it has not re ceived the slightest Intimation regarding Japan's course in connection with the last Russian note.

Senator dp.oor.er deliv ered a brilliant fpeoeh In the Senate to-day in. which he completely refute the charge of ST- 3 tain Democrats that the President by r.esotiat- I ing a canal treaty with l'arxama bad violate th provisions of the Spooler amendment. With remarkable tenacity o fjorft leJ'pite 3 innumerable interruptions, the Senator from I Wisconsin adhered to the thread of bsi Ua coune. and, beginning with the i --.ion of the Hay-Kerran treaty by the Colombian Con- I gress. traced the cour3e cf events to the revolt a tion in Panama, compelling the admi3sior. from his opponents that there was no rtregarl of that provision of the Spoor.' act which rrjuired the President to turn to Nicaragua if ur.abla to secure the Panama route within a reaao time. So far from having violated the act of Con- 1 gresa, the President has scrupulously obeyed It. declared the Senator, ar.d he compelled an ad- mission of his proposition from Senator Tman. who had undertaken to question the logic of . Wisconsin Senator. Senators lillman, Xewlar.ds and others fre quently interrupted, usually with an attempt to bring Mr. BwaaM to the consideration of atib sequent event, but the Wisconsin Senator, wh urn answering the objections, declared that he wou take up each phase of the subject as he came t it. Knowing that he will continue his argument later, he paused long enough to-day to declar that the President has violated no principle o international law, and in response to the dec laration of Tman that a more discreet Presi dent would have awaited the meeting of Con gress or. November 0 before recognizing the r.e- public cf Panama, he declared vehemently than . no President had ever seen lit to consult th legislative branch of the government regarding a similar action, which was purely executive '.a it 3 character, and none but a weak President. ever would do so. He cited numerous precedent and quoted the Constitution in support of nisi argument. Solid as was Mr. Spooler's logic, and serious a.i was his subject, the debate was not without its humorous side. The picturesque language of Mr. Tillman and the ready wit, which the Wisconsin Senator displayed in answers to nisi ph.'rt sleeve opponent elicited most continue OU3 laughter from the galleries and from Sen ators on both sides of the chamber. An appeal jo the Southern Senator to lay as'dai all partisan Bias. and, dealing with the subject vith his customary candor, to say what hat would have done, brought forth the following response from Mr. Tman If I were President I 3hould have said to Colombia You are a mansry lot you are bio- ing the progress of civilization sret off the earth we propose to build that canal. Senator SDOoner's speech was a source of a Teat ratification to his coigues as it wa of discomfort to his opponents, and as he haaj declared his Intention of continuing his argu ment, taking up more extensively the landing off marines at Colon, the recognition of Panama, etc.. an even more brilliant effort is expected Ut the near future. DEFENCE OF PRESIDENT. Spooner' Sharp Replies to Cr.rmacli and Tillman. By Tfco aaweMsl Piers. Washington, Jan. 13. Panama again to-day was the principal subject of, consideration in the Senataw and the debate was spirited. Mr. CarznacJt opened the proceedings with a speech in criticism of tha . President's course, and was followed by Mr. Spooner in define of the President's acton as law abiding and in defence of the President himself aa a 'patriotic, brve and true man. Mr. Til'mau frequently lpterjujei Mr. Spooner. ami then were a number bf sharp encounters between the i. When the Senate adjourned the Panama question was still up. and It was announced that the dis cussion would be resumed to-morrow after iha disposition of the Postofflce Department inquiry, rt solutions.

CAP.MACK ATTACKS PRESIDENT. Mr. Carmack began with a reference to Mr. Lodges speech, and said he was always pleased I hear him when he descended from Boston to earth. That Senator should understand that there ahou.. be a limit, even to the zeal of an administrate i Senator, and if he were less of a partisan he we .. i be standing here denouncing the acts of the Presi dent, as he would be if the President were a Demo crat. He contended that there had been no par sanship In the attitude of the Democratic Senator,. On the other hand, the Republican administration had been guilty of the worst kind of partisanship v refusing to execute the Spooner law because or I -. fear that the opposition would secure an advantage. The President, he said, had made it plain tha . never had intended to execute the Nicaragua pro visions of the Spooner act. Never for one mo ment. he declared, did he consider any plan lha.9 had In It so little of the strenuous and the sensa tional as the execution of the law. If. instead eff peering Into the future. A3 Mr Loorr.lM tellj us h did, he had peered lnt the law. he would Sana saved the country much trouble. Mr. Carmack contended that President Rooseve had not contented himself with recognition of Pan-i ama, but had Intervened. Hi acts were not sim ply offensive, not simply a cause for war, but they were war. he said. As a matter of fact, there never w.-i any insur rection on the isthmus. said Mr. Oraaca They apeak of the rising, he said, as the act of or. man. Very true. And that one man was th President of the United States. Discussing the act of Colonel Black, of the United States Army. in raising the first flag in the Panami Republic, the Senator criticised him sharply. Wai know. he said, what would happen if at any other place an officer of the United States should be found plotting with the enemies of a country with which we were at peace. I do not bettor thar Colonel Black would have engaged In this plot If he hadn't believed that he was doing the will of the administration. Mr. Carmack said the President had denied that he had encouraged the Panama insurrection. but no greater encouragement could be shown than by Mas, Mr. Bunau-Vai la and a few other choice spirits a hint that If a revolution was started It would receive the support of the United States. Who could not get up a South American revolu I tlon with the aid of the United States military forces and JKVOO.WO he demanded. Quoting from a recent speech by Mr. Loomia, Assistant Secretary of State. Mr. Carmack said it had been evident since las June that Colombia had no Intention of ratifying tr. Hay-Herran treaty. If that Is true. said he, then th- Pr-.siden ha been proceeding contrary to laws of hi 3 country in not going to the Ntcarasuan rout- Mr. Carmack declared that a mob has as muck right to hang Its victim as the President to smbwSS what he wants by disregard of the law. President Roosevelt, he said, loses the power of reasoning and his moral sense when he becomes involved ta action, and he exclaimed Into what fiultien may we not be led by this headlong man He did not agree that the President would hay hesitated if Colombia had been a - ajM nation. On the contrary, th President would have wel comed such an opportunity. He makes history aa he would order a melodrama, mK . certain that the star performer is always In the centre of tSe stage.

The leading feature of the debate In the Senate to-day was the speech on Panama made by Senator Depew, who spoke to crowded galleries and a well tilled chamber. Although Mr. Depew had given notice of his In tention of addressing himself to the Panama question to-day, he cams near being crowded out by Senator Spooner. Mr. Spooner. who peaks extemporaneously, and. as a rule, only when be becomes so charged with Ideas that he can no longer contain himself, arose to reply briefly to certain animadversions of Mr. New lands, who had spoken earlier In the day. In tending to speak only a moment. Mr. Spooner quickly -warmed to his subject, while Senator Depew politely waited for him to conclude his remarks. When It became obvious that the Sens tor from Wisconsin was petting well under way for a speech of several hours, a note was ent to him by Senator Aldrlch. calling his at tention to the fact that Mr. Depew was sched uled for a epeecft. In a moment more another not came from Senator Allison, and then fol lowed several other, and the eloquent Wis consin Senator gradually put on the brakes and eventually subsided, after which Mr. Depew toured the floor. Mr. Depew said that the opponents of the treaty are aiding the enemies of the canaL It. he continued, there ha been a concert of ac tion among any great railway corporations to defeat this most beneficent work of commerce and civilization. I am not aware of it, but if such a combination does exist, then its allies and ft most efficient assistant are to be found among Chose who. under any device or excuse, are endeavoring to defeat the treaty with th Republic of Panama. He went into details concerning the Hay-Her ran treaty, declaring that President Marroquin of Colombia had the Colombian Congress In his power and dictated the course pursued by It, with the end in view of securing better finan cial terms from the United States at the ex- Ik pease of the canal company. He charged Marro m null. with Ignorance of the fact that the United W Btates has a conscience. We are, he said, a commercial nation. Our people are trained to all refinements of business obligations and all the reciprocal relations of contracts. Much as we want the canal, we never could have taken It by becoming a partner in this highway robbery Df the property of the citizens of France. Mr. rpevr controverted the argument that the potijtion of the United States in recognizing the Republic of Panama was a reversal of the na tional position on Eecestlon. After reviewing diplomatic history in the rec- Dgnition of new countries. Mr. Depew said No State ever became independent so completely, to righteously, or so timely as Panama.

No President ever did a more timely or mere patriotic act than did President Roosevelt In his recognition and defense of the Republic cf Panama. Mr. Derew ridiculed as lurid the contention that the President had made war on Colombia- He declared that in his dependence on the De mocracy of the United States, President Mar roguin forgot that party was not in power in ny branch of the government of this country, nd that two of the Southern States had already Instructed tht-ir Senators to vote for the canal treaty, and others were likely to follow their trarr Mr Newlands, of Nevada, spoke in criticism of the President's policy. He conceded that the President had not been bound, because a rea nable time- had not elapsed, to turn from the Panama to the Nicaragua route. He also as tented to the proposition that the United State bad a grievance against Colombia 02 account of the rejection of the Hay-Herran treaty. But he contended that the action of the United Btates In preventing the landing of Colombian troops in Panama was an intervention that mounted to a declaration of war. He engaged In a controversy with Mr. Fpooner as to the guarantee of the right of transit. He said he was willing to admit that the spirit of the treaty nf 1846 calls for the building of the canal, but even with that construction Colombia's refusal to allow the building of the canal would not have been cause tor war or for the landing of American troops in Panama. He also com plained that the President had prematurely recognized Panama. The established methods of fliplcmacy were ignored, and immediate and prompt trmtd intervention and a display of force were made, without complying with the formal procedure required by international law. Had these, outrages been committed, Mr. Newlands added, by the Executive en a great power like England or Russia or Germany, Con gress would promptly disavow them and shall the impotence of Colombia disqualify her from receiving satisfaction for injury inflicted on her Kr the unauthorized and unconstitutional action of this country's Chief Executive Mr. Spooner congratulated Mr. Newlaads on whit he called an espousal of the doctrine of in ternational eminent domain. It was. he said, a recognition of the right to cut away through tha isthmus for the purpose of wedding the two oceans, dependent only on the payment of dam ages. Mr. Newland said he was not prepared to ac cept this definition of his own position, and had accepted the President's position only for the alee of the argument.

TWO SCIENTISTS DEAD. Mother arid Daughter, of Laconia, N. 11. , Wouldn't Have Doctor. BT TKIECBi-PH TO TUB TBIBUXE.J Laconla, X. H., Jan. 14. Mrs. Mary McLosky, seventy-three years old, nnd her daughter Alice, thirty-three years old, both residents of this city, are dead from pneumonia, and the certificate 6igned by Dr. George H. Saltmarsh. local physi cian, called into the case, gives as the cause of death lack of care and proper treatment. Mrs. McLosky died on January 0, after having refused to accept the cervices of a physician. Miss McLosky, who was ill with the same mal ady at the death of the mother, died on January 12 In the same circumstances. Last Monday the daughter was attended by a Christian Science healer from Boston, who administered treat ment consistent with the faith to restore the young woman to normal heaith. The Boston healer gave assurance that her condition was much improved so much so that he urged her removal to Boston, where she would be more in touch with Christian Science healers and him self in particular. So much assurance was attached to the healer's statements that friends, against their own desires and satisfied that tbe unfortunate woman was even then at death's door, assisted her to take a train for Boston. A few hours later 6he reached her destination. Chariestown, Mass., the home of a sister-in-law. Mrs. William B. McLosky, where death came three hours after ber arrival. Miss McbMfcy as well as the mother had been 6trong beiievers in Christian Science for three years, and were both charter members and chief organizers of the Laeonia Christian Bcience So ciety, instituted here early last epringf. Mis. McLosky bad lived here twenty-five years, be ing wne of. the city's most esteemed residents, and like the daughter, was popular. Both formed a wide circle of friends and acquaint ances outside of vaiious social and religious or ganizations to which they were prominently identified for many years. At the time of her illness, despite the entreaty of relatives and iriend, Mrs. McLosky refused medical attendance, and the same was true of the daughter, the latter being ewn more strenuously opposed to receiving assistance from a physician. The developments in the case have stirred public sentiment here to a high pitch as nothing in the. line of such unusual happenings in the Winnipesaiikee Valley has produced such niental tension before for many years. The funeral of Miss Mclysky took place at Park Street Free Will Baptist Church this afternoon. So far as observation extended not a single member of the Christian Science faith was among the audience which packed the auditorium to the doors. The body was deposited beside that of the mother, in the family tomb at Bayslde Cemetery. OEE WORTH 250, A TON. Found in Two-Inch Streaks in a Cripple Creek Mine. BI TELEnAI-H TO TUC TIMBCNE.

The Appointment of Ex-Commissioner Hynes the Last Straw. Charles T. Murphy returned from Washington yesterday at 4 p. m., but he did not go to Tam many Hall, where about fifty politicians were wait ing to ask him several pointed Questions about Mayor McClellan's appointments. Mr. Murphy made the trip from Washlntfton with Norman E. Mack, and after reaching his home, in Stuyvesaut Square, denied himself to all callers. The Mayor's latest offence, in the opinion of Tammany men, was committed yesterday, when he announced the appointment of Thomas W. Hynes, Commissioner of Correction under the Low admin istration, to be New-York City's commissioner to the St. Louis Exposition. Where does Hynes come in How long has Hynes belonged to the organiza tion Who stands for Hynes These were some of the questions asked yester day at Tammany Hall, and again last night at the Anawanda Club, whose members are still waiting fur patronage.

Followed Quarrel with Girl's Mother Arrest and Confession. South Norwalk, Conn., Jan. 14. William Car penter, twenty-one years old. shot and seriously wounded his sweetheart. Miss Margaret Nevils, to-night. Carpenter fired at the girl three times, and each shot took effect. Miss Nevils was car ried to the South Norwalk Hospital, and the physicians, after an examination, said that the girl's condition was critical. Carpenter at tempted to escape after the shooting, but was caught by the police. At Police Headquarters he confessed to Chief Vollmer. but said that the shooting was not premeditated. Carpenter, whose home Is in Stamford, has been calling on Miss Nevils for some time. To night be had an argument with the girl's mother. When he left the house Miss Nevlls accompanied him to the street, where, accord- Ing to his own story, he renewed the argument with the girl, who had been upholding her mother. The couple were walking near the Nevlla home, when Carpenter suddenly drew a revolver from his pocket and tired three shots in rapid succession at the girl. One bullet en tered one of the girl's lungs, another struck her in the chin and the third made a glancing wound on the cheek. The first bullet was the most serious of the three, and at the hospital it was feared that it had penetrated the abdominal wall and entered the stomach. Carpenter, after firing the shots, turned and ran across a vacant lot and out onto the street. He had Just started down the street, when he ran into the arms of a policeman, who had heard the shots and who was hurrying to investigate the cause. The policeman took Carpenter to the hospital to which Miss Nevils had been re now .1. The young woman identified Carpenter as the m.-in who fired the shots. Carpenter was then takn to the police station, where he broke town and cried violently. He admitted the jhootiig, but said that in th heat of an argu ment with the girl he lost his head and fired the shots without realizing what he was doing. .9. P. A. XOW DEBT FREE. First Time in Its History Build ing Mortgage Paid. President Haines. in his annual report for tho Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani mals, says that all encumbrances on the Madl ron-ave building have been removed, and that for the first time In its history the society Is entirely free from debt. The report ay The year 1903 has benn a time of serious an3 severe trial to nearly all charitable associations in the city of New- fork. It is reported on ex cellent authority that the managers of every hospital in the city are confronted with a de ficit of thousands of dollars In their receipts as compare with their necessary expenditures. In some cases the amount is so great aa to cause serious embarrassment, and tho total, so far as reported, reacboa the large sum of nearly half a million of dollars. According to the best in formation I have been able to obtain, a similar shrinkage of income has been experienced In nearly. If not quite, all other charitable institu tions. We have not only been enabled to pay every dollar of the year's expenses, but aiso to extinguish the last mortgage with which the headquarters of tbe society were burdened. The death of Frederic Reno Ceudert. who waa actively connected with the society, is referred to as causing a serious loss to the organization. The various special Instances where the so ciety has Interfered In behalf of abused ani mals during the last year are referred to. A long distance race from Chadron to Chicago was practically broken up, says Mr. Haines, through the posting of warnings along the proposed route. Only nine entries were finally made, and no hard riding was done. Another, planned to take place between Omaha and Dead wood, Mr. Haines states, was prevented altogether. Th bullfight plannefl for the Alabama State Fair, the proposed cocking main near Louisville, Ky., and a simUar affair to have taken place near Birmingham, Ala., are mentioned as having been prevented by the society. Mr. Haines also takes to the organization the credit for pre venting a cat-mice-catching tournament at Stamford, Coun.

Russia and Japan to come to terms and so avert open hostilities. The Czar also is reported to b extremely desirous of preventing war. Taking these two conflicting sets of advices Into con sideration, the official opinion here is that Japan will not yield to any such pressure. The Japanese Minister has supplied the State Department an abstract of the last Japanese note. Count Cassini, the Russian Ambassador, on his part, has acquainted the State Depart ment verbally, as is his custom, with the nature of the Russian note, so that the department la fully informed bu as both these communica tions have been made In confidence, tha offi cials do not feel they should make them public In whole or In part. It Is said, however, that there has been no sub stantial change in the Japanese proposition or the Russian counter-proposal since they were announced by The Associated Press In Us semi official dispatch from Peking last week. Sir Mortimer Durand, the British Ambassador, also had a conference to-day with Secretary Hay on the Far Eastern situation. Advices on the subject received at the Brltih Embassy are of a gloomy nature. Paris, Jan. 14. The Intention on the part of certain European powers to find means to pre vent the Kusso-Japanese controversy drifting into actual war, as intimated in these dispatches yesterday, has begun to assume definite propor tions, though until to-day these means were con fined to an exchange of views between the Cab inets as to what course waa desirable, and It can ba asserted positively that no Under of mediation or good offices has yet been made to Japan or Russia, as It is the accepted vlaw that a grave moment which would warrant repre sentlons from the outside has not been reached. The form of the representations will be that known in diplomatic usage as a tender of good offices. This consists mainly in giving friendly advice for the maintenance of peace. In tho present case it is likely to include rather definite suggestions that the outside powers consider that the main questions causing the present dif ferences are entirely susceptible to pacific ad justment. How far the other Cabinets of Europe and the United States Cabinet will give moral or actual support to the friendly repre sentations is au open question, as the exchanges of views have thus far been confined mainly to London and Paris. But throughout the ex changes there has been a strong sentiment ttal the unit-d Influence of Europe and the United States should give at least moral support to the efforts to avert a conflict. WHY JAP AS DELAYS, London Learns Mikado Wants Time to Mobilize Troops and Ships. London. Jan, 14 The British Foreign Office officials said to-night, m'ter reading the Japanese reply to the last Russian note, that it only car ried the crisis a step further In a les hopeful direction. The advices received by the Foreign Office made them fear that Russia would not ac cept Japan's re.terated demands. A private dispatch from Toklo, received at one of the embassies here frum a. source con sidered quite reliable, said that in spite of all reports to the contrary the Japanese troops would not be thoroughly prepared to start for Corea before the first week In February. This was considered significant in conjunction with Baron Hayashl'B estimate that the negotiations were likely to extend for three weeks longer and aj supplying an additional reason for Japan answering in pacific terms. It wu also pointed out that in three weeks Japan's new cruisers would be practically out of all danger. tieveral of the diplomats here do r.ot share the British Foreign Office's complete pessimism, and believe Russia, will give in a.t the last moment. At the German Embassy it v.ma thought that Berlin's depression yesterday was due to some communication from St. Petersburg intimat-g that Russia would go to war rather tfcan con cede some particular points of Japan's de mands. Minister Hayashl received this morning th text of the Japanese reply. It did not contain an ultimatum, but reiterated Japan's otig-.aaJ demands, with what Baron Hayashl terms a. modification upon a minor point. The questions of Chinese sovereignty in Man churia and Japan's sphere of Influence in Corea were again insisted upon. Minister Hayashi said to a representative of The Associated Press Bo far aa I can see. the relations of the two powers regarding the dispute are practically unchanged. I have no Indication of the recep tion which this note is likely to meet at the hands of the Russian government, but I xpect the negotiations will continue for sev eral weeks. In regard to the reports from Paris of the possible Intervention of Great Britain and France, the Foreign Office eald that no such steps were on foot, so far as Great Britain was concerned. No request had been received from either Russia or Japan for such action, and tha Foreign Office added that it feared the tirna had passed for any Intervention to be efficacious. ORDERS BATTLESHIP.

A dispatch from Paris on January 7 said that a newspaper of that city had received a dispatch from Constantinople that Russia was nego tiating with Turkey to permit her Black Sea fleet' to pass through the Dardanelles. The announce ment alarmed the Japanese government, and the authorities at Tokio instructed the Japanese Min ister in London to make Inquiries.

Apprehension that there rill be war is still expressed in official quarters tiere. where It is also said that a Japanese at lans is possible at any moment. At the same time the authorities declare that, with the ex ce'. of strategic precaution taken between Llao-Yang and the Yalu River, their plans have not been formed, and that it will be impossible to rcmplete the arrangements until the Japanese ir.nke more definite demonstrations of their in tentions. The fortification and field troops are active, and between Liao-Yang and the Siberian border the railroad is overtaxed in transporting recruits and replacing the regiments dispatched to the Yalu River.

Minister Griscom's message from Tokio to the State Department at Washington, paying, on the authority of the British Ambassa dor at St. Petersburg, that the Russian reply to Japan would be satisfactory, was based on the following facts On January 2 the British Minister at St. rsl.urg telegraphed to Lord Lansdowne that Own t Lamsdorff said the Russian reply would be dispatched the name evening, and that h fCoaat Imsdorff believed it would be satis factory to Japan. These farts were retele- VTapbad to the British Minister to Japan, Sir cim-de M. Macdonald, and wer'.- also communl eated t the diplomats who attended Lord Lansdowne's reception on January 27. Count l.itisdorfTs Intentions, however, evidently mis tarrtafl, for the Foreign office and the Japanese Iteration both confirm the statements from St. -.-t.urg and Tokio yesterday that no reply had yet. been sent, ar.d that there is nothing to Indicate what its real nature will be. The Daily Graphic, which to-day reasserts that the Russian reply was communicated to Japan n January 27. was probably misled by a partial knowledge of the contents of the tele gram received here from the British Ambassa dor at St. Petersburg. The Foreign Office, confirming the statement cf the Japanese Legation, adds- ROAD FOR THOOPS ONLY. -To Stop Traffic Through Siberia Kuropatkin't Command. London. Jan. 30.

I don't think the information is df finite enough to call for any formal expression from me at thi time. It is probable that Japan has received the communication from Russia which is pointed to as the basis of the rumored lte ment, and in the natural course of events it will not be known for a wees' t more whether the amended provisions will meet Japan's, ap proval. If on country deterimir,s upon war, of course war will be unavoidable. In internatiml rels tions it does not require two to mak a quarrel, and aggressive action on the part of either of the parties at issue will naturally precipitate a conflict. He was asked what effect on the cotton and wheat markets of this country a declaration f war in the Far East uouM iroduce. I do not believe, he replied, 'that It would hava . any .effect whatever either upon the. size, of next season's crops or the prif-s these prod ucts will bring in the markets of the world. Asked about the reported movement of Colom bian troops into Panama, he replied Beally. I never discuss mntters f State away from Washington. I hope Colotnbla will realise, however, that such an attempt must be uselesi 'and fruitless. The Independent status of Pana ma is too well recognized to admit of its subju gation now by Colombia. Mr. Ha asked with inu h interest for the latest news from General Reyes and as t whether he was still in the country. The State r-partn-Tit. h- said, sipriiflcnnily. does not play politic.

Her mother, the paper says, had visited her on Saturday, Jan uary 23, and evidently was the bearer of im portant news. The governor of the prison on Sunday conferred with the prison officials with a view to arranging for the departure of tho prisoner, which was out auiotly. Mrs. Maybrick, the statement adds, accom panied by one of the prison matrons, entered a closed carriage and drove to Aylesbury sta tion, where she took a train for London. Sh- got off a Euston Station, and from there went to a private home not fir from the me tropolis. She will remain it the home for a short period, in order to recuperate and to await the completion of certain formalities which will give her a freedom of movement not allowed by persons on ordinary ticket-of leave. The paper says in conclusion that In the last few months in prison she was employed in the lightest work as a reward for good conduct. Florence C. Maybrick. th daughter of the late W. O. Chandler, a banker of Mobile, Ala., was convicted at Liverpool In 18S9 of having paISSBMi her husband, Jamts Maybrick. a cotton broker, who lived part of the lime In Norfolk and part in Liverpool, and sentenced to death.

STAGE FOLK STRANDED. Six Thousand Out of Work in Chicago. TBT TELBHSAPII TO THE TEIBfXE. Chicago. Jan. .TO. -Six thousand stage folk are stranded here, it is estimated by agents. With the number being increased daily through the cloning of theatre and attractions in neighbor ing cities and States, this city, because of the Iroquois fire and Its results, is now the centre of the greatest pnnlc that has overtaken the amusement business In its history In America. Showing a serenity puzzling to the public and even to those in close touch with the theatrical profession, managers, agents, actors, actresses, chorus girls, stage mechanics, bill posters and members of other crafts identified with the mimic world are awaiting want. Yet they spurn ofTcrs of engagements at panic salaries. and murmur unpleusant criticism about some of the alleged benefits planned In the name of the profession. It's a case of the survival of the fittest, and probably the starvation of the rest. said one oldtime stage manager. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S ROYALTY. Has Not Yet Received 1, oa Sales of His Books. TrBOU THE TRTBf.VE BCKEAr. 1 Washington. Jan. .HO. There was surprise in Washington at the New-York report that the President had received royalties on the sale of his books by Gebbie Co. to the amount of 150,. The fact is. the President's royalties have not yet aggregated 1, all told. The erroneous statement appears to have grown out of a misunderstanding of Mr. Roosevelt's con tract with his publishers, which entitles him to no'larger royalties on editions de luxe than on th- odiniry prints. The President's publisher is Putnam, and Mr. Koosevelt is not a party to any arrangement between Putnam and Gebbie. ex cept that he receives a stipulated amount on each set of books sold by Putnam.

The call of the Indian contingent at the White House was soon fotsVWVd by a report to the effect that Senator Fairbanks had Indicated his willingness to accept the nomination for sec end place on the Ticket. This report, as circu lated. is Incorrect, but it Is true that a number of the Senator's friends hope they will be able tm prevail on him to accept the second place, They beltevo he woulrt hll strength to the ,, and feel thnt Indinna should be repre ntd They are ,-ertafM th-i If ftenator Fair banks cun be Induced to accept the nomination for Vlce-Prenldent no more adtiiralle ticket could be presented, none that would command not only the sid Republican vote but a great number of Independent and Democratic votes. There is 'i general feeling that, wltli Indiana frankly avowing Its loyalty to the Preside the last vestige of opposition to the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt has disappeared, and speculation now naturally turns to the personality of the man who will fill second place.

COLOMBIA MOKE WARLIKE THREAT TO SEXD TROOl'. Government Said To Be HelpUu tt Preveit War. News of a most disquieting character was con tained in a cable dispatch recelv-d in this ciiy last night from an official scur.f Ir. Bogota. Thia well authenticated message res.'.

This oureener.t of c, irlng strife conflrmi rumors cabled yesterday from Panama, thi Co lombla Intends to organise end end an expedi tion asainst Panama. It -omesi as n surprise. In view of the suppos.-l chansed attitu.l of the Colombians, who had apparently accepted the inevitable and depneJ on General Rafael Reyes, Colombia's special envoy to Washing ton, to obtain through diplomat y som- compen sation for the loss of Panama. General Reyes was to sail yesterday n th steamer Valencia for Barrai.quHla. and them proceed to Bogota. But. much to the surprise of his friends, he rfrfe.red hi 3 departure for the second time. He was as reticent about this sec ond change of plans as v.hen he failed to salt on the steamer Alleghany. two weeks ago. atter having announced that he would sail. Gen eral Pedro nel Osplna and Dr. Lucas Caballero. collea of ilenernl Reyes on th Colombian Commission, want by the steamer Valencia, They. too. v. ere uncommunicative. In Washington the expected return of General Reyes to Bogota was regarded as a gnarante that the Jingo element In Bogota would be. quiet ed, as he wields a great persona Influence, which has been directed toward maintaining peace. General Reyes occupies a most awkward and embarrassing posit On seemingly good au thority It Is stated that he has not left here yet because his negotiations with the State De partment at Washington have not been com pletely broken off and he has a tentative prom ise from this government that Colombia shall be taken care of with pecuniary balm for her loss of the canal strip. General Reyes, with evi dent sincerity, has deprecated the foolhardy desire of some of his compatriots for war with the United States. He has used every Influence at his command to discourage such a movement, and has advised his government, and through it his people, of the terrible consequences they would suffer from the one sided conflict which a' war between the two countries would mean. General Reyes, at the Hoffman House, last night j would make no comment on the threatening dis patch from Bogota. In view of circumstances rather peculiar. to say the least, the official advices from the cap- Ital indicate that the Colombian government is not acting in entire good faith. Although it declares that it Is powerless to prevent an out break, it has become known that official prepa rations of rather a warlike character have been steadily going on. The Colombian government has purchased at New-Orleana a steamer to ba used as a transport for troops, and the addwial information comes from QuayaquiL Etna dm, that fire thousand rifles have arrived there from Belgium In transit for Colombia. These latest ilsMlopssti in the Colamhla Panama entanglement are the more sfrtllna because of the pacific withdrawal of the Catni bian troops which had bean sent up the Atrato River to Cape Tiburon. which to close to rba Panama border. No further hostile action o the part of Colombia was looked for. GORMAN DEFEATED AGAI S Democratic Senators Unable Uk Agree on Panama Policy. - irSOM THE TWBCNS BCMAf. Washington. Jan. 30. Senator Gorman pre sentfd for the consideration of his party eel leagues in a caucus held to-day, at which a special Injunction of secrecy was issued to all present, two schemes which he believes may add considerably to the embarrassment ot the administration, and possibly even result hi that act of warfare on the part of Colombia whhdl is the remaining source of hope of the anti canal faction n the Senate. Mr. lor man's pet scheme is the passage of the resolution, calling for an investigation bg tho Committee on Foreign Relations of the ru mor that Mr. Bunau-Varilla or other people h the I'nited States promoted or contributed to the Panama revolution. It was argued in the caucus to-day that the passage of this resolu tion must result in an investigation which could easily be prolonged for the greater part of the present session and almost until the opening of the eaasaahjb It would afford an opportunity for the introduction of the most sensational evi dence, which, although it might be disproved, would be allowed to leak out to the press and would inevitably produce some effect, and pos sibly save to the Democrats a few votes. It would put the administration to considerable embarrassment, because it would become neces sary to sammon witnesses, probably from as far away as Panama, to disprove th evidence which the opposition would be able to introduce. This resolution was the chief topic of debate in the caucus, and it appealed strongly to the Gorman- Bailey faction, and. were there any hkussa of unity in the Democratic ranks. Senator Stones resolution might have been adopted as a party measure. There were, how ever, a number of Democrats present who ap j.reiiated that .-.uch a course, doomed to inev itable ultimate exposure, would bring down on them the censure of their constituents, and they hel 1 back in sufficient numbers to make it Im possible to adopt the Stone resolution by a two thirds vote and thus bind the party In the Senate. Defeated in his attempt to put through this mischievous programme. Mr. Gorman then turned his attention to his second scheme. This was the adoption as a party measure of the Bacon resolution. It does not present such a wealth of mischief making power, but Mr. Bacon advanced the idea that it might rob the admin istration of the credit of negotiating any treaty wjth Colombia which would remove all aorenesa from the diplomatic relations of the two coun tries and that would be a step In the Jastut, direction. The Gorman- Bacon programme, how ever, was. met with an argument suggested by Senator Spooner. who yesterday penned an ironical summary of the Bacon raaohltlan and passed tt around the Senate Chamber. It read Whereas. The United States took no part tn bringing about the revolution in Panama and la tn no wise responsible for the same therefore, be it Resolved. That the United States bn. th question of damages oustalnrd by Colombia to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague m order to de t.-vr.e what sum of money the United States should pay to Colombia.

A Union Railway Company trolley car. de scending at full speed one of the steepest hills In The Bronx, in Westehester-ave., at Inter vale-ave., soon after 0 oclock last evening, hit a girder weighing several tons on a six horse truck at the foot of the hill. The girder went half way through the car, seriously Injuring the motorman and at least a score of passen gers. The car waa wrecked. Another car, behind It. unable to stop, hit the first car, driving the girder further through It.

Bryan's declaration that the Kansas City platform, with IU free silver peawk, must be re affirmed. If he can fate it, means thnt the can didate of the pnrty must run upon a free silver issue, and that will kill him at the start. Bryan has ceased to b reasonable.

CHARLES W. CLARK. Chairman Congressional Commit WILLIAM WARNER. Chairman Convention. Senator Hopkins, of Illinois, called en th President this morning and assured him that th Illinois delegation would arrive at the Chicago convention Instructed for Roosevelt. Later Sen ator Hopkins said to a representative of Th Tribune There Is absolutely no question regarding th Rvoll eenttmei in Illinois. Th delegation will certainly be Instructed for him. and I do nC blieve that one Congress district can be foand In the State that ill not support the President .for the nomination. All reports to th contrary come from misinformed sources. Senator Cullom received to-day from th an nual 'love feast of the Illinois Republican a telegram assuring him that the party In thn.t tat was unequivocally for Roosevelt, and Rep resentative Rodenberg. who has Just returned from Southern Illinois, says that no one la talk- Ing of any candidate but Roosevelt. Representative Crumpacker. of Indiana. a corted State Senator E. 11. Wolcott to th Presi dent's office to-day. Indiana is for nr---.-' heart and soul. said Senator Wolcott. not only because he has made a goo.i President and th people like the way he does things, bat also be cause Judge Crumpaeker and most of th other members and both Senators are for htm. As for the talk of Senator Hanna's candidacy, no waa in my part of the State takes much stock In it. We pay Senator Ilanna the compliment of be lieving what he says when he asserts that he is rot looking for the place. Senator Wolcott added that Indiana would, as usual, give a large Republican majority this year. Florida has taken the lead among the South ern delegations in oming out for Roosevelt, but reports are reaching Washington to the effect that several other Southern States are prepar ing to follow suit. There Is a general dispositi'.in among the Southern Republicans to ktp to gether. Tennessee will swing into line scon. and. it is expected, will be followed by Arkansas. and gradually by most of the other Southern States. MISSOURIANS FOR ROOSEVELT.

RUSSIA RETARDS REPLY. Anrtrer To Be Sent Xc.rt Week Japan's Attitude Feared. St. Petersburg. Jan. 29. The authorities here row say that the Russian reply to Japan wl at be transmitted us.tll next week. It Is Bald thrt the delay was caused by the extreme care taken in drafting the document. Viceroy Alexieff's views are also awaited before its transmission to the Czar. It is fully realized here that the forwarding of tne answer will mark another critical stage la the negotiations, everything depending on fapaaiia attitude. It is feared that, despite Influences, the hands of the authorities BBSy be forced on account of the excitement of the press and people. A high official said f course, we cannot prevent war. Russia mil do her utmost to offer Japan a basis for a damhte peace, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go. In Corea we grant practically svety thing, and in Manchuria we already recog nize all tile treaty rights of Japan and all the ethr powers. Should Japan reject our con ciliatory propositions the world must place the responsibility upon Japan. Within a fortnight both Russia and Japan liave officially communicated to the United 6ts'es and to the European chancelleries their position regarding some of the points at issue. This course was considered necessary in view cf the aiytug reports. The Foreign Minister, Count Lamsdorff, in his interview with the Japanese Minister, M. Kurir.o. last night, indicated that Russia's reply xroulA be dispatched next week. It is known that the strategic situation was dseoassfl by the military authorities present at tci-day's and 'sterday's meetings of the Council Cf State.

It will be so conciliatory that I do not foresee cihe-r than a peaceful settlement, although it Is difficult to feei c-rtain in this rencct, because of the erratic course of the Japanese govern r.eni in the later stages of the negotiations. Jaj n has increased her demar.ds while the nesoilations were stil in progrpsa by insisting upon treaty recognition of Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria. Russia has declared her Inten tion not to annex Manchuria terior' why comply with a demand that Is tantamount to a. buiinatir.g reiteration of a former voluntary dcdaratSonT It Is undeniable that the attitude of Japan Is oetag irnt.-.tion In Bt.

The Pflgrims of the United .States, with Bishop Potter presiding, were holding a dinner in honor of Sir Henry Mortimer Durand. th British Am bassador, at Delmonlco'a. At the identical hour tho British PUgrtnaa, cf whom Lord Roberts is president, were having supper at the Carlton Hotel, London. By arrangement with the Commercial Cable Company, at 7 p. m.. New-York time, and mid night, London time, a direct wire had been run Into the dlninp room of each hotel. For thirty minutes last night space was annihilated and prominent representatives of the two greatest English speaking nations, though separated by thousands of miles f tossing sea, exchanged international courtesies. Back and forth be neath tho ocean sung the messages of interna tional fellowship nnd pood will between Bishop Potter and Lord Roberta. Lord Roberts and Sir Mortimer, Lieutenant General Sir William Nlch o'on ami Major General Corbin. Lord Brassey bt-.i Morris K. Jesup, and a dozen others well known m their several walks of life. The ppeech of tho British Ambassador, show- Ing the further invisible bonds of a dual kind that were being woven that night between the two countries, waa typical of the entire spirit of the evening on hth si' The Pilgrims have for their object the -xten sion and c lent Ing of Anglo-American friend ship, and this was the leit-motif of the entire dinner and the diners. In a measur.-d and deliberate speech the British AmtMdor, who was applauded with great enthusiasm, showed the obligations be tween the two countries, their bonds of reech and heredity, and their debt to the world. Th respective .Masts of President Roosevelt and King Edwnrd were drunk at DetmoniCO'S with a spontaneity and enthusiasm that showed the cordiality existing letween the two nations.

Kansas is the storm centre of a freight rate war in grain, and within the next fortnight it is likely that the State will be pretty thoroughly drained of the twenty million bushel3 of wheat which are supposed to be held by the farmers. The Santa F has an nounced a cut of five cents a hundred In the rate en gram from -nterior Kansas point to Galveston by th- dirc-.-t route. The probability is that the Eastern roads, which depend for their business on the haul to Mlnneapom Chicago or Eastern ports, will make a cut in thb rate3 to turn some of the business in that direction. Instead of allowing it all to slip away by the back door cf the Gulf. In addition to the cut made by the Santa Fe. the Bock Island and the Missouri Pacific have given notice of a reduction of two cents in the rates to the Gu'.f by way of Kansas City. m In wliat orhsv w.iy can rtftv esats be as well in v-stti for . youn person as in a copy of The Fnur- Trach Ncv.d for liXU Five cents at uewsdcaiej s. tarti Mi.IIT AGAINST ADDICKS.

He went on to say thai no self-respecting opponent of Addicks could fur ther cenafder priniilUmq for lisissa iij tn the Delaware factions. Ftnntor Bil t.Vked with emphasis, and made it eaierty known that the antl-Addic'.s faction will ffrjht Addicks to his polltlca death ard ask ro n.uarter. Thy ae, he wont on to say, greatly desirous oi harmeny and of bringing all the elements together, but this can never be accorr.plishe. by th methods which Mr. Adii now proposes. In a signed --.-tide Mr. Addicks declared that the Regular Republicans, having Offered peace and unity to the bolter. and having met a refusal, have determined to go on their way without tnaatlt'g any more propositions. No common primaries will be held anywhere, and straight tickets will be put In lh nd in every county for every purpose. Straight Union Re publican candidates, pledged to vote for J. Ed ward Addteka fcr I'nited States Senator first, last and all th iine. will be nominate In every teglalattve district in th State, and aS who do not like this policv caa vote some other ticket. ' declared Mr. Addicks. Kither J. Edward Ad dlcfca or a Demoeral will be seit to Um Senate la placi of Senator Ba, whose term expires u year from next Man h. according to Adclicks. Addicka further says that Ganeiaw Hunn will he renomlnatd to succeed himself ard vl be re-elected. He says that an early State convention will se held and a delegation sent to Chicago that will contain no bolters. The list Is to be headed by Addicks. who will l.e elected national committeeman to succeed him self. Senator Ball declared that he had never seen surh a statement in his life from a public man. There was no doubt, h said, that Addicks meant what he said, that either himself or a Democrat would be sent to the Senate to suc ceed Senator Ball. He would prefer the suc cp.ss of a Democrat any time to a Republican unless than Republican should be himself. as serted Senator Hall, who went on to point out that it was Impossible for a self-respecting Re publlcan any longer to try to bring about har mony ia the face of the egotistical and vu'.Rar assertions of A'ldlcks as to what will be done In Delaware. The complacency with which Mr. Addicks declares what is to be done, and what progrM is to be followed by the T'nion Re publicans, as his faction Is called, has greatly Incensed the other faction, and this feeling in mud- more bitter by Addlcks's comment that 'those who during the past ten years have put on f h- livery of Heaven to serve the devil' can flock by themselves, with Ball. Htggins and Du ront for leaders. The Presid'-nt cannot with propriety take a hand in the ir, and will not. Some of the Re publican national leaders may attempt to do something in that direction, as the continua tion of the flsnt may mean the loss of the elec toral vote to the Republican Candida for President in No ember. The recognition of the AddJckS faction at Chicago would undnuitedly cattse the other friction to knife the national ticket, while the recognition of the antl-Addioks element would be followed by an overwhelming I-mocratic majority in the State, as the Ad dicka people hive twice as many voters as the other side. THE BANCROFT IX ACTION San Bias Indians Attempt to Capt ure Gunboat. Colon. Jan. 29 The I'nited States gunboat Bancwrft arrived hen to-day from the San Bias roast. She reports the attitude of the San Bias Indians at Caledoria Bay to be not only unfriendly, but decidedly aggressive. Last Tuesday men from one of the Bancroft's boats Insisted upon buying a few cocoanuts from th Indians, and paid more than full value for them. Toward 11 o'clock that night, when it was dark, twenty canoes were seen approaching the Ban croft. The gunboat turned her searchlight on the caaees, and it showed that each boat car ried as n'.iiny Indians as i-ouU possibly crowd in. probaMy two hundred in all. All the men were armed with bows and arrows, guns of quaint old pattern and other weapons. Their fans were besmeared with paint. There is no doubt that their Intentions were hostile. They hoped to reach and surprise the ship. The commander of the Bancroft ordered th Kunboat cleared for action, and her guns were loaded and trimmed ready for use. A quick firing Colt gun was placed near the gangway, and orders were given to the gunners of this piece to keep up a ceaseless fire all around the canoes. As soon as the- Tndians heard this rain of bul lets they immediately began retreating toward the shore. The gunners werr ordered not to fire, at the Indians, so the briilet3 cut the air and churned up the water around them. No shots wer fired at the Bancroft, which at one sailed for Coion to report the occurrence. LORD BRASSEY' DIES IK CHICAGO. Passed Worthless Checks and Drank Much Liquor. bt sjMai to tie Trr-vF.

How about your conference with the Sea tcr rid you taiU about legislation he was ' Yes. rptd UM Covernor. that was what I cme darwa for to discuss certain legislative nnd political mitt-rs with the Senator. We bad a very psl t.lk. Iwlafl tw hours. I make it a rule to say nothing nbout legislative mat ters unii they are oniily before me. You wre quoteil as being against the Xcw ccmb bill. If I was so quoted I must have been mls o.ticted f-r I hive not taken any position one way or the other toward the MB. But. why so ntnxh dirt ussier, nt the excise bill It does not a r rear, from the Albany end. to .e so extremely important. There have been no delegations t rsk for Smday opening legislation, and ther does rot appear to be any particularly urgent call for f.r.y legislation of that character.' Jer'-me wanted it a y- ar ago, It waa sug gested. Yes. said the Governor, quickly, but Je rome didn't dare go to the people on that prasjo sit ion. Mayer McClellan eays he has no power te regulate the alleged extortions of the Gat Trust. it wa3 suggested. Why doesn't he ask for power, then re plied the Governor. If it would not be an in fringement of home, rule, and here the Gov ernor smiled, why doesn't he ask the legis lature for power to do something with iruMss service corporations he may suspect are over stepping their rights in deilins with the people T The Governor said he expected to appoint tho Canal Commission some tin's next week. He returned to Albany on the 5. J0 train, after a short chat with ex-Pnatcr J. Sloat Fassctt. of Elmira. When Senator Platt was seen last night he seemed to be in a Jovial frame of mind. I had a talk with the Govrnor lasting an hour or two. he said, and if it is of any particular Interns t tne public I might add that every thing is harmonious between the Republican leaders of th State. What did you and the Governor talk aboct About legislation at Albany ar.d Ptate poK tlcs. With reference to the legislation I cannot say much at this time, for the reason that cer tain features of proposed legislation are under discusulo. We discussed the Xewromb bi. I cannot speak for the Governor, but it strikes me that he is not very fully in accord with the main features of the Xewcomb bill. There will be some kind of an excise bill passed for this city, however and I believe that it will satisfy enlighter.ed blie sentiment. Senator Platt was asked if he had noticed that the Western States were instructing delegates for Roosevelt day by day. Yes. I have noticed it. and it Is gratifying.- I am informed that there is no doubt whatever that Illinois and Indiana, will Instruct for Roosevelt, and I am willing to predict here and row tbtt Ohio will instruct for him too. How about New-Tork I certainly expect that the delegates from this State will be instructed for Rcosevelt. Tney will f I have anything to say about it. and X expect to have. If we can't win with Roose velt, we can't win with anybody. H Is the strongest candidate we can name. Whatever defects he may have are obvious and well known to the people. They know him. It will be different with our friends the enemy. What ever man they nominate for President will bo subjected to searching criticism by all the wlr.gs and factions in the Democratic party. I don't know Just how strong the Democrats will be It they norrinate this Judge up the Hudson. His strongest point eems to be that he bas no rec ord, except that of a Judge. He waa elected om a fluke. There won't be any fluke this year. Did you notice that President James Stlilznaat of the National City Bank dined with the Presi dent r 'Tes, 11 said Mr. Ptatt. with a quick smile. X saw that in the papers this afternoon. Mr. Stillman represents a considerable element In the financial world. If he should com out squarely for President Roosevelt it would mate a considerable difference in Wall Street. Wlil he Well. said Mr. Platt. cs he laughed softly, 1 don't know whether h will or not. A gootl deal depends or. 'he President, I guess. Ild Mr. Fassett have any nws 'Senator Fassert came down to talk ever ttiet situation in hla Congressional district. There Is a deadlock, on account of contesting delesationa frcm Sneca CtoUllty. I advhwd Senator Fas setl to go slow. I would be very sad Indeed to .ee him elected to Congress, as he would makej a Ptrcng Representative, but I don't want to se any f.arht spruntr In th district tia.t w1l cot the fiKieral t'-ket ny votes.'

Part, Jan. s lt was learned to-day that the greatewr difference bStVBSM Rucp'.a and Japan arises from the proposal made by ItniSils that a neutral zone ehall be established extending from Ping- Yang In C'orea on the south to the Rus rian frontier on the north. Th Russian government has expressed a will ingness to recognize the preponderating influ ence of Japan In the remainder of Corea and the fvro powers are agreed respecting the prin ciple of the integrity of China and of Corea. Japan, however, saw no reason why the pro poped neutral zone should be established, hold ing that the entire peninsula should be subject to her influence. The attitude of Russia. Is believed to he flue to the fact that If Japan controls Corea Saw will thereby be able more easily to menace Port Ar thur as well as Vladivostok. The diplomat who gave the foregoing informa tion expressed himself as confident that Russia in her reply to Japan will piv- way on this vital point. One of the mopt piniflcai-.t features of the message from Tokio is the statement that Japan Is hastening preparations for a far more -jt'-n- Elve dispatch of troons to Corea than at first contemplated. The government has now decided to Bri an army of SSj men, organized as two divisions, to Cnr-.i. This Is more than 3ouM the strength of the expedition rst contemplated, Ml arm i mull a large flf-et of transports and exteiisive arrangements, which are proceeding rapidly toward completion. The destination of thai army Is expected to be Southern Corea, particularly Pufan and SCasanpnO. The officials here at first understood that Rus sia would net object to the dispatch of the ex pedition, but the -T.Stude of the plans bein to rale some doubt as to whether Russia will acquiesce. Although no positive advices have bee, given of the preparations for the dispatch ef this array, tbe report excites some apprehen lor, as It is anil ft may develop Into the first move In th possible conflict. Rumors are In circulation at Marseille that a French naval division, composed of the ar mored cruisers Ki,er. Iefaix and Amral Aube Ml the turret ship Buffern, is about to receive order to eal for th Far BNat The reports, however, cannot be confirmed here, but there is reaaon to believe that the naval authorities are oonsMerin the disposition of the warships In ca6 of a serious turn In the situation. This is due mainly to the present email French naval force In the I'aclflc, which s confined to two un important vessels. CONCESSIONS BY RUSSIA. Rephf Accepts Part of Japan's Pro posal New Offers.

Tho question of making theatres In this city safe and preventing a disaster In New-York like that at the Iroquots Theatre In Chicago was considered yesterday at a conference be tween Mayor UcClellan, Firs Commissioner Hares. Police Commissioner McAdoo, Health Commissioner Darlington, Borough President Ahearn and Theodore Connoly. representing Corporation Counsel Delany. Th Mayor called the conference In his office at the request of Mr. Hayes, and after It was over the Mayor paid he had requested both th Firs Commissioner and the Health Commissioner to hay examina tions made of all the theatres in the five bor oughs of the city. He also had requested the presidents of the boroughs to have their super intendents of buildings make reports about the theatres and other places of amusement In th several boroughs, regarding the manner In which such buildings comply or fail to comply with the building laws. The 'inspection of the theatres by order of Fire oCmcnfMi r r Hayes is .lradly partly completed, and the reports of that inspection will deal chiefly with asbestos curtains, exits and heating and lighting ierent. The Mayor will receive the reports In a day or two. Health Commissioner Darlington report will deal with the sanitary conditions at the theatres, including th means of ventilation. It may be several days before the sanitary of ficials can complete such an investigation. When the reports are received, if it is found that a theatre Is unsafe by reason of failure to comply with the lire, sanitary and building regulations, the Mayor may take steps to close it until the place is made safe. When 1 receive the reports, Mayor McClellan caM yesterday, I shall take such action as will prevent any violation of the law at the theatres In the future, and stop any that is discovered. I have taken the action to-day because of the Justifiable public sentiment which has been aroused by the Chicago fire. Will you close any theatre if its manager shows a disposition to delay such alterations as may be found necessary was asked. NOT TO CONSIDER MANAGERS. We shall override any each disposition, th Mayor said. The convenience of th theatre managers Is not to be considered when it Is a question of life or death for the public. Borough President Ahearn pent for Mr. Thompson. the Superintendent of Buildings, and ordered him to let everything else wait upon an inspection of the theatre buildings In Manhat tan. He told Mr. Thompson to have th reports on the theatres ready at the earliest possible minute. Fire Commissioner Hayes said In the after noon that be had received a special report from Foreman Lenihan regarding the asbestos cur tains in theatres in Manhattan. Th report says that all the theatres have asbestos curtains which appear to be fireproof and in good work ing order except the Orpheus Music Hall, at No. 125 Bast One-hundredf-and-twenty-liflh-st tha Circle Theatre, at Broadway and Slxtleth-st.. and Huber's Museum, at No. 10j East Four teenth-st. The Commissioner Bald he had not taken any st3p to dose those places of amuse ment whl-h had do asbestos curtains for the stage, as he did not know that he had the power to take such action, but he was willing to let the public know of the lack of safety at those places. The Mayor yesterday asked Police Commis sioner llcAdoo to have two additional police men stationed in es h theatre during each per formance. One of the policemen is to stay in the balcony and the Other In the gallery, and they will expected to see that there is no blocking of th stairways or aisles or over crowding of the lobbies. In case of disturb ances from any cause, the police would be ex pected to Bid hi preventing panics. The attention of Fire Commissions Hayes was called yesterday to a report that -he had shown favor to the theatres controlled by what is known as the theatrical syndicate In not Includinff any of them In the list of places to which he detailed additional firemen. He said he did not recognize any syndicates and did not consider the ownership of any theatre in his desire to have all the theatres made safe. I have been told to-day, however, he added, that oie so-called syndicate theatre Is in cluded in my l' st - This is Daly's Theatre. Is there to be any favor shown to the Dewey The.ttn. said to be controlled by Tim othy D. Sullivan was asked. DENIES FAVOR TO SULLIVAN.

We shall need, therefore, throughout the coming campaign, to keep constantly before the people the often proved Incapacity of the Democratic party to conduct public affairs, and the menace to busi ness which proceeds from its very constitution. BRYAN A XT BOCIAUSM. The newspapers relate that Mr. Bryan denies that he is a socialist, but the spirit of socialism is rampant in his party, and its Influence will appear at the moment when any Democratic President sets foot in the Whit.- House. it will make little difference who ho la or here he comes from he must yield to the spirit hi larty. and be its Instrument, or he must break his party, and be the rock on which it splits in pieces. The government Is, not a personal machine. Our Presidents have been great and successful, not by dominating their party, bat by conducting their administration in harmony with party sentiments. Then, when party sen timent baa approved wise, and successful poli cies, they have taken their places in the list of great men. WHY CLEVELAND FAILED. The history of Mr. Cleveland la a perfect 11 lustration of my point. He was made be Demi - i..' candidate for his availability, but as poon as the entire government bee me Democratic In his second term 11 was straightway discovered that between .i conservative President and .1 radical party there was no possibility of suc cessful government Ah the President became more conservative the party became more radi cal, and the effect of their struggles for control was felt in the profits of every business and the earnings of every working man. The tariff smashers and the currency debasers in the Dem ocratic party may be for the moment quiescent, but self-restraint will last no single minute longer than until the opportunity comes to give effect to their Injurious principles. WORLD MARKETS AND POLITICS. Membership in Coisres3 Is Increasing In both honor and importance. Circumstances have forced us to depart from the oldtime rule sepa rating us from the affairs of the rest of the world, and many of the policies we are adopting now not only affect other people than our own, but look far ahead Into the future, one accord our public men are directing thei atten tions to the great problem of securing new mar kets for American made good. The Americas policy is not one of conquest or of paramount political Influence, It does not ask special con sideration. It asks no more than an equal ritrht for th.- American people to trade In the world's markets, and It opposes the policy of any nation which, going outside of its own territory, under takes to set up metes and bounds within which Its p -ople can trade. our entrance Into world politics. if so larpe an expression be descriptive, has been eyed by the other nations In a spirit of hearty friend ship They have the assurance of our physical situation that It can have no ulterior purpose. but it brings to us as members of Congress new questions and new responsibilities, and I take It to be a great privilege to be a member of the House or the Senate at this time in our country's development The necessity of new markets and better commercial facilities was felt by the people long before it appeared In government policies. The construction of an Isthmian canal transcends In importance any other act of legislation or diplomacy to which the government can commit itself, and the peo ple will look impatiently, In my opinion, at any individual OT political party that seeks to em barrass this work with partisan outcries. If this session of Congress accomplishes nothing els- than to render possible the Immediate con struction of the canal across the isthmus, it will have done enough to entitle it to a hisch place in the list of useful and memorable ses sions. .

RISIBJ BriFAr. 1 Washington, Jan. ... Does New-Tern want tariff revision This question was put to a number of prominent business men in New-York during the holiday recess by Senate leader who took advantage of th resi to visit the metropolis. On-j of the Senators a Western Republican, says that he beard in hotel lobbies and financial gatherings ii New-Tori City many expressions of opposition to President Roosevelt, not be cause of anything he has done, but on account of what it is claimed he may do. This Senator was told by several New-Yorkers who have fallen lnt. the habit Of casting their votes from a mugwump standpoint that, if the Democrats nominated a good mas ne v.oii. carry New- York. The Senator ashed thm if the people of New-York desired to brint about a condition of affairs sack as existed In Mr. Cleveland's second administration, and they re plied that the Senate was safely Republican .mi a Democratic administration cosJd do no harm. The Senator says his reply was somethlSSJ like this Gentlemen, i think I may safely assume that, If you Insist upon electing Democratic Presi dent, you win at th same time elect a Demo cratic House of Representatives It requires a change of only fifteen seats m the Hoose to do this. Now, in this situation it weald be as more than natural to expect the passage by the House of a tariff bill embodying th traditional policy of the Democrats in favor si a tariff for revenue only. A Republican Senate saved you from yaw on a similar occasion, when Mr. - iveartii was President for the first ttmo. I am reason ably sure that in the present temper of a eertata number of RepabUcan Senators you cannot on an unbroken Semite t.. ssr i again, if you again mslst apea commlrttng harlkarl with the eountrys Imstnnw interests, some of the present Republican Senators will take h ai the sense of the p 4 n-- that they wmt a change from th Republican t. the Tteam cratic poi,y. Th'-. uill be eiMMBSji Republican Senators this time, uitlj the aid of rhe gelid Democracy, to sivt- you what you want. The statement appeared to startle the m,i who were complaining r what the President might do If elected. Later on that same day this Western Senator, who bj a member Of the Senate Finance Committee met another Repub lican member of the same committee and toUl him what ho had said, whereupon the oth-r member of the committee emphatically In dorsed the propisitiop. The Tribune correspond r can state positively thai at least two Re publican members of the Ifsnals Finance Committee, to which all tariff bills are referred, are sure, should New-York be foolish nsad to give its vote to the Den'cracy and thus bring about a condition which would force a disastrous readjustment of the business con ditions of the country, to do their share toward allowing a Democratic tariff bill to sro saea the statute books and there is but little douot that a number of Western Republican Senators sufficient to bring about such a result, would be entirely agrreeable to the proposition. XO DEMOCRATIC UNITY, Only Seventeen Senators Willing to Pledge Themselves Against Canal. FROM THE TRIBUNE BUREAU. Washington. Jan. You couldn't bind the Democratic party In the Senate to support the Ten Commandments. remarked Senator Duhois to-day, as he sank wearily Into a chair after having completed, with the aid of his friend. Senator Carmack. a poll of his party colleagues on the Panama question, only to find that only seventeen out of the thirty-three Democratic Senators were willing to bind themselves to a policy of opposition to the canal. The disintegration of the Democratic opposi tion to the canal has long been apparent to every one but Senator Gorman and his stanch allies and lieutenants. Dubois and Carmack, but they have persisted in their belief that the ad ministration could be embarrassed and the coun try won in the election of next year by the de feat of the Panama treaty until to-day, when actual count revealed the fact that the Repub licans could rely on sixteen Democratic votes in support of the canal convention. The declaration of Mr. Olney for the candi dacy of ex- President Cleveland, made In New- York last night, proved another source of sorrow to the Democrats in both houses of Congress. There is probably no class of men who would be so unwilling to nee the former President a candi date as the politicians of his own party, and, entirely aside from the chagrin of Senator Gor man at seeing the strength of his oldtime enemy. th rank and file ot the Democrats in Congress were seriously disturbed at Mr. Olney's declara tion. They expressed themselves, almost to a man. as believing that Mr. Olney had put him self out of the running by once more espous ing the cause of his former chieftain. LODGE'S STRONG SUPPORT.

The Senator received the must careful atten tion from crowd- galleries and his lltfTeexmi on both sides of the Senate Chamber, most oi whom remained throughout the tons oration, and most of whom broke the nil of the Seuafel and greeted the conclusion of the speech with a burst of applause.

We have often hnd fortune showered upon us by our Democratic friends, but nothing better could happen than i, nominate their last Democratic reform Presi dent on the policy of sustaining Cbtomba ad opj.oslns the I'ntd States in digging the canal at Panama. Senator Lodge said in the course of hla argu ment that an attempt had been made to be cloud the issue because the course of Panamas had been one of secession, whereas the United States had prevented the secession of the South ern States. In fact, secession was. in Its ulti mate analysis, revolution. In 1775 the colon revolted from the rule of Great Britain, ami France recognized the colonies. Was Franc therefore to be regarded as having established a precedent whereby she was hound to submit to the secession of a portion of her own terri tory The fact that the Catted States nized Texas had no bearing on the propo-t secession of the Southern States. PRECEDENTS FOR RECOGNITION. He likened the recognition of the American colonies by France to the recognition of Pan ama by the United States, saying that the col onies had only a. de facto government and wera without a constitution. After citing othr precedents in support of his contention. th Senator asserted the proposition that the right to recognize a new government was vested, solely In the executive branch of the govern ment. He emphasized the secrecy and dis patch not Infrequently necessary to such recog nition, and pointed out how impossible It would be to confide such power to a legislative body, quoting Hamilton In support of the contention", "New York"], ["0 Ing his mysterious mission.

Th trial of Senator Dietrich for allege bribery, in connection with a post fflce appointment at Hastings, Neb., ciune to an abrupt end to-day when the United States Clr ult Court, Judge Van Devanter presiding, de cided that Mr Dietrich was not a Senator at the time the alleged acts occurred. The opinion iva a Jong one. and is said to establish a precedent. The effect of the decision Is that a man Is not an actual member of Congress from the time of hit lection until he takes the oath at the bar of the bouse to which he is elected, and that he Is not amenable to the law as a member of Con gress and officer of the United States In that in terval. Diirlct Attorney Summers entered a nolle roejul in the other cases against the Senator nd Postmaster Jacob Fisher, of Hastings, Neb.. with the statement that the construction placed on the law by the court precluded further pro ceedings against either Senator Dietrich or Mr. r lLer. both of whom were discharged. On account of a statement made to the press torn time ago on behalf of Senator Dietrich, to she effect that he did not wish to take advan tage of any technicality, but v.anted the case tried on Its merits. In order that he might be fully vindicated. Genera Cowln, Senator Diet rich's chief counsel, to-day gave out a state ment of his reasons for demurring to the in dictment. In effect it was that, as the court Itself would insist on an adjudication of the question whether Mr. Dietrich were a United Ptatei Senator during the period covered by the alleged unlawful acts. General Cowln decided that the demurrer should be Interposed before the taking of testimony should begin. He ex plained that otherwise the court, at the close of the case for the prosecution, would raise the point In question, which would preclude the de fence from presenting any evidence in refuta tion of the testimony introduced by the prosecu tion. V.'hen General Cowln'a statement was shown to District Attorney Summers he said The answer to that statement Is this Official ly this office has nothing to pay the court has settled the matter. If Senator Dietrich desired to secure a vindication through a trial of the case on its merits, he had an opportunity to do -o by not raising the technical point of whether or not h was a member of Congress from the time of his election to his taking the oath of office. DRTGGS CASE DIFFERENT. flayers Think Acquittal of Senator Dietrich Will Not A feet It. Many friends of ex-Conjressman Edmund H. Drlggi. the Democratic politician convicted in Brooklyn on Thursday of having violated the fed eral Jaw ln accepting compensation for Retting con tracts with the Postofflce Department for a private concern, read with interest yesterday of the order- Ing cf a verdict of not guilty In the case against United State Senator Dietrich of Nebraska by Judge Van Devanter in Omaha. The Judge took this action after the couufel for the accused raised he contention that Senator Dietrich could not be held under the indictment, because at the time of the alleged offence he was only a Senator-elect and bad not become a Senator under the moaning of the statute, as he had not taken the oath of office. As Mr. Driggs at the lime of his offence ras only a Coiur-bsnian-elect and had not taken the oath of office, soir.e of his friends thought that Judge Van Devanters decision might apply to the Brooklyn man. Hugo Hirch. counsel for Mr. Drijrss. admitted. ', v r - tr.t tb Dirir, decision could not hi applied to his client, because the two men were lnrtciei unoer different statutes.

Tr.o Indictments of JJrigg under this tame statute were dismissed fry me because he was not a qualified Representative rot having taken the oath of office. The indict ment under which Mr. Drtggs wits convicted was Ujdsr Section 1.782, wfck-h applies to acts com mitted by persons elected to Congr- after the election and during their term of office. The question of the constitutionality of the law Ed ether points upon which Mr. Hirsch will prob ably base his appeal fro-n the conviction had been argued txfo.f. ml considered by Jud-j Thomas before the Judge dismissed Mr. lilrschs demurrer to the Indictments.

If the House of Refuge, on Randall's Island, reveals any possible weak point ln the armor of Its fire precautions and facilities, the weakness apparently lies not so much in the safeguards to prelect its Inmates as to protect the officers and matrons themselves. In the officers' and matrons' quarters, which lie to the extreme right and left of the main building, the complete absence of fire escapes is not atoned for by the presence of only one exit in each case. This exit, however, could scarcely be better than It is one of the s'.ate and iron corridors that are a feature of the Refuge. That no possible precaution shall be neglected, how ever. Superintendent Omar V. Page yesterday, ln view of the Chicago theatre holocaust, wrote the Department of Charities recommending the erection of two fire escape. one attached to the male officers' quarters and another to the ma trons' quarters, asking in the meanwhile for iroo staples and one-Inch rope in case of an emer gency at these points. An Investigation of the entire fire arrange ments on Randall's Island by a Tribune re porter yesterday went to show that resources in care of fire which at the Island hospital, in fants' hoypital end schools under Superintend ent Mrs. M. C. Dunphy were unexceptionable, reached a high standard ln the House of Ref uge, under Superintendent Gage. Unlike the western division of Ward's Island. the condition of arnica was told In yesterday's Tribute, both divisions of Randall's have two firemen specially detailed, good and abundant hse, a modern fire engine periodically tested and inspected, and other facilities and protec tions. By the Superintendent of tha House of Ref vge. however, the engine house is regarded as a rather secondary portion of his fire fighting apparatus, for the especially adapted fire pre cautions and contrivances In the Refuge Include four water tanks, each containing a uniform quantity of water some l. gallons which newer varies, however much may be withdrawn. A well trained volunteer fire brigade, some fifty strong two trebly fireproof slate and Iron stair nays In each of tho fourteen boys' and girls' dormitories, and stand plpe and hose ln every dormitory connected with the tanks, make pos sible an almost instantaneous flushing of any portion of the Refuge. In both divisions the general local fire signal Is a long ear-splitting blast, followed by three short ones from a upecially constructed siren, called the Great Whistle. whose sound, it is asserted, on a clear day can he heard for a distance of thirty miles. The fifty-two boys of the First Division ln the House of Refuse, who are quartered on the east side of the first hall. are the institution's fire brigade, commanded by the military instructor. .They take part ln a practical fire drill at least or.cc a week. A periodic fire alarm test is also given to the en tire body of the Inmates. The fact that ln each dormitory, throughout the night, an officer is stationed on a dais also tends to lessen the chinee of any possible surprise by fire in this direction. Instant communication between the superintendent's office and officer who may be scattered throughout the Refuge Is also estab lished by rr.eana of telephone and electric call bells. Ou'-de the buildings re several fresh water hydrants, in addition to one with salt water pressure, invaluable not only because of Its in creased pressure, but because It means that at Wst one out.ide pipe will he slow to freeze. The regular fireboat alarm Is also available in case of emergency. In Mrs. Dummy's division of the Island, which includes the Infants 1 Hospital, Children's Hos pital, North and South Hospitals, Reception Building. Eye and Medical and Surgical pa vilions, and the School for the Feeble Minded, with a total present census of about twelve hundred, against nine hundred ln the House of Kefuge, the cxtia precautions, if relatively prim ule, are generally unobjectionable. Here again ihe 6iren is sounded as the general alarm, coir.munl'.-atlon -with the scattered officers is es tablithed only by telephone, and tho local alarm ln individual Luildinja ia eounded ty tolling a hand g-jng. Any advantage which this division may enjoy over the House of Refuge in a number of all- Iron escapes ie discounted by the fact that the Inner stairways are in many cases of wood. Hero any danger which might exist from the Uf-e of furnace ranges is avoided ly the exclu sive employment of steam heat. As in the House of Keiuge, there are two fire men, who drill monthly with an up to date en gine, reels of good hose and a hook and ladder. Here, also, in addition to periodic examinations by a Fire Department Inspector, lectures are given to the nurses on fire precautions and ac tion in case of fire breaking out. Here the lire force is about thirty ftroiig, composed entirely of employes, who drill three or four times a month. Naturally, its efficiency rests on a somewhat different plane from that of the lire brigade of the House of Refuge. Th buildings of both divisions, with the ex ception of smaller pavilions, are constructed mainly of F.tone or brick, yellow pine, however, being largely used In the flooring. In the oaee of a tire in either division, the su perintendents co-operate. In Mrs. Dunphy'a di vision there is a periodic tire alarm test. The nurses are constantly Instructed how to allay panic among thoir charges in ease of fire, and the charges how to dress and descend quickly and quietly In any serious emergency.

Seeks the Co-operation of Theatrical Men in Safeguarding Public. There will be a continuous performance in the Mayor's office at the City Hall to-day, begin ning at 9 a. m.. at which the theatre managers of Manhattan wilJ take turns in heart to heart talks with Mayor McClellan. Announcement of the programme for to-day vias made late yesterday afternoon by the Mayor, after he had held an hour's conference with Corporation Couns-1 Delany, Fire Commissioner Hayes, Health Commissioner Darlington. President Ahearn of Manhatan Borough and Mr. Thomp son, the superintendent of buildings for Man hattan. The purpose of the conference which I have held, the Mayor said, has been to produce harmonious action among the departments hav ing relations with the theatres, because the reg ulations as to the theatres divide the responsi bility. The conferences have shown that all the departments concerned are glad to co-operate in united action to make the theatres of the city safe. There have been inspections going on day by day, and the reports of such inspections have been before us. As a result of the conferences, I have asked all the theatre managers in Manhattan to come here and see me to-morrow and talk over with me plans for making theatres safe. I want them to co-operate with me in carrying out recom mendations which are to be formulated by a commute composed of representatives of the Fire Df-partment, the Health Department and the Department of Buildings. This committed will get together immediately and report general reconui.endailons as to changes in the theatres, and these recommendations will be given to the managers for their sruidance. The purpose we have ln view Is to safeguard the public and allay apprehension at the theatres. For that reason we believe the man agers vi ill co-operate with us. The recommenda tions of the committee will be of a character to apply to all theatres. They may be formulated to-night or to-morrow, and I expect them to be ready certainly by Monday morning. Are you to have all the theatre managers here together was asked. Oh. no, said the Mayor. They will come before me one at a time, beginning at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning. The conditions at the va rious theatres differ, and each theatre manager will be asked to co-operate In making changes according to condition. Suppose some of the managers do not want to co-operate in carrying out the recommenda tions We shall put. the recommendations Into ef fect. said the Mayor, sharply, but there is a question whether we can put them into effect at once, or slowly. We want the co-operation of the managers in order hat the recommendations can be earned out at once. Probably there will be no necessity for closing any theatres. Henry S. Thompson. Superintendent of Build ings in Manhattan, heard yesterday that sev eral theatre managers were complying with his order to make stage scenery fireproof. Some of the managers said they had ten making their Kftnery fireproof all along, and did not need pro.ldlng on that subject. David Belasca said lie had kept the scenery in his thea're frer-n,, r M c 'V - vtlUn etoe on the stage, since his theatre was built At the same time the asbestos curtain hai been kept In rood working urd.

Superintendent Wood, the first witness, said that the pipe from which the steam escapi 1 was there fur tho puipose of prevent ing the freezing of the water supply pipe fur the engines. He said that if the steam obscured the motormon's vision he should have so reduced his speed as to have b'n a.ie to stop after he saw the train ahead. For that reason he hi,i Wans r responsible for ihe accident. Wanser then told his own story, prefacing- It by the statement that he had been employed ,n tho road for sixteen years, during which tiri he hnd never l.een reported for Infraction of the rules.

Ratification of Panama Treaty Not Likely To Be Delayed Long. fFBOM THE TRIBUTE BUREAC.I Washington. Jan. 15. 1t Is hoped that the consideration of the Panama Canal treaty by the Foreign Relations Committee will be com pleted in a few days, after which it will be taken up in the Senate. Senator Gorman to day proposed amendments to the set of resolu tions offered by him which render them. In the opinion of leading Republicans, entirely in nocuous, so that they are likely to be adopted at an early date. This change is regarded as Inrgely in the nature of a retreat on the part of the Senator from Maryland, who probably has finally come to appreciate how entirely un tenable is his opposition to the Panama treaty. Once the treaty is reported to the Senate the rublic debate will cease. Almost continuous executive sessions will be held, and final ratifi cation is not likely to be seriously delayed. The debate of the last week is re'gaxded as having cleared the atmosphere and prepared the way for ratification, and once more the prospect of a comparatively early adjournment Is being dis cussed. PAX AM A W THE SENATE. Spooner and Tillman Have Another Lively Colloquy. Washington. Jan. 15. After the passage of a number of minor measures to-day, tna Gorman Panama resolution wap laid before the Senate. Mr. Gorman offered a number of amendments, striking out the word Intervention wherever it appears, thus modifying the resolution so as to make it an inquiry of the President concerning the use of American military forces in the Isthmus of Pan ama. Mr. Cullom. in view of the amendments, withdrew his motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on Foreign Relations, and said he was willing to have a vote on it. Mr. Lodge, however, asked to have the resolu tion, as amended, printed, and lie over for an other day. and that order was made. Mr. Teller then spoke on the Panama question, sayiug he believed it should be treated from a non partisaa point of view. H thought, however, that whenever the President transcended his duty the fact should be pointed out. In the present instance he did not doubt the good intentions of tha Presi dent, but he distrusted of his wisdom in what he had done. His objection was not. he said, based on any fear of war with Colombia, because Co lombia had shown that she was too wise to enter into a conflict of arms with the United States. He had no complaint to make against Panama, for he thought the people of that country had the right to revolt. Indeed, he thought if he had lived in Panama he would have been a rebel himself. Thla right of the Panamans did not, however, alter the duty of the United States to remain neutral. He asserted that a new State coming into existence by secession should be recognised only when It had established its capacity to maintain its indepen dence. There should be no interference so long as there was a likelihood of the success of the parent State. This rule. Mr. Teller dtclared, had not been ni in Panama. Mr. Platt. of Connecticut, asked whether under any circumstances the United States had a right to protect transit across the Isthmus, but Mr. Teller declared that the question was academic and said he would not argue the case on that general ground. He was willing to discuss the right to interfere as the President had done, and was ready to contend that his interference was in con travention of international law. When Mr. Teller referred to Mr. Tman's char acterization of the situation on the isthmus, the latter interrupted to say that he had been mis understood and desired to explain. He meant to say that it would have been preferable for the United States to tell Colombia to get on the isth mus entirely than for us to pursue there the methods of the sneak thief and maintain the atti tude of a bully. In response to a Suggestion made by Mr. Teller, Mr. Spooncr interrupted to say that by tfte treaty of 1546 Colombia was bound to maintain the per petual right of the United States to passage across the isthmus and he argued that that right re mains, even though Colombia dors not etand be hind it. Mr. Teller admitted that any right the United States had under Colombia she still had under Panama, if Panama was an established power. He then asked tor an opinion from Mr. Spooner con cerning the new theory Jof International eminent domain. and tho latter replied that he had not yet been able to jdvo his assent to that doctrine, which, as he understood it, meant that when a weak nation had what .1 strong nation needed the latter mieht take it ly means of arms if neces sary. Yet it must be remembered that right of way of one landowner over lamd owned by another person Is a. right recognized by the world. If. he eaid. there is a doctrine of the private way of necessity, are we to pay that there is not an inter national way of necessity where the interest of the world is concerned - There were interruptions at this point, causing Mr. Tillman to remark that It taken a gr3t many doctors to bring about the birth of this baby. I'll try to take care of my own baby, respond ed Mr. Spooner. and when I can't do that I will ask some member of my own family to do so. The colloquy caused a general outburst of laugh ter. After it had FUbsided Mr. Spooner continued his statement, saying he was willing to confess that he had not reached a conclusion In his own mind. I am not willing to concede the rifrhr of International eminent domain, but I can't find it in my heart to deny it. h paid. Mr. Teller look issue with the President's dec laration that the course pursued in Panama had teen in the interest of ''collective civilization. That, he said, was a dangerous doctrine, and was Just Fueh a doctrine as Russia might apDeal to if Fhe should attempt to crush Japan. The doctrine was not Americar. It was contrary to all the best traditions of this country. It was the doctrine that might makes right. He discussed the government of Panama, declaring it to be unrepublican 'n form, and was interrupted by Mr. Spooner. who said that it had been a mooted question as to whether there is a republican form of government in Colorado. If. responded Mr. Teller, there is not a re publican form of government in Colorado, there is a Republican administration there. When Mr. Teller ceased speaking, the Senate passed a large number of private pension bills and adjourned until Monday. ORGANIZING IN PANAMA. Constitutional Convention Meets Good Feeling Shown. Panama. Jan. 15. Members of the Junta and several consular representatives were present to-day at the first session of the Constitutional Convention, which was also attended by a great crowd of, people. Dr. Pablo Arosemena, temporary president of the convention, delivered the opening address, which was repeatedly interrupted by applause. Among other things, he said The republic will live less by Its material power than by the virtues it will practice. In dependence must be maintained and the republic must adopt without reserve that policy of probity which is born of justice and knowledge. Dr. Arosemena reviewed the favorable au spices under which the republic had been born, and said Its security is protected by a powerful peo ple in whose veins runs the rich blood of those Puritans who shook off the torment of re ligious intolerance and the opprobrium of politi cal despotism. Dr. Arosemena concluded by recommending that in the exercise of their duties the members of the convention should keep their country in their hearts and minds. Dr. Eusebia Morales delivered the Junta's menage to the convention, after which the ministers left the meeting. The B TenttOW appointed Aristicies Arjona. Juan Batista Amador and Manuel C. Jurado a committee to draw up un answer to the Junta's mcraag . l-.ixsentatlve Burgos proposed that ths convention should fend patriotic Balute to the Junta for its distinguished services to the country. This was unanimously approved, thus Indicating the cardinal relations which exist be tween the legislative and executive jjowers. GUATEMALA RECOGNIZES PANAMA. Washington. Jar..

Giving United States Control Over Panama and Colon Harbors. Washington. Jan. IS. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations to-day adopted an amendment to the Panama. Canal treaty providing that the United States shall have the right to dredge and improva the narbors of Panama and Colon and that this government shall bave control of the harbors for this purpose and for making them suitable for all conditions of commerce. It is said Hiat further information concerning th conditions at Panama and Colon as to the harbors may render the amend ment unnecessary. Under the treaty the harbors are not Included in the grant to this government, and the point has been raised that the Republic of Panama ha 3 the power to adopt regulations which might interfere with the free operation of the shippln ot the world. Tho Republican members of the committee are inclined to favor a few minor amendments, if only for the purpose of brinsrlng about ratit'ostion of the convention b the Constitutional Convention of the new republic, and thu meet and dispose of one of the vigorously fought contentions of the Democrats that tne tratv ha not been ratified by a tangible form of government. THE CONVENTION CALL Continued from first pafa. vanced to show why its immediate issue is be coming imperative. Most of these were given in these dispatches of last night, but It may be added that in some sections the law provide that every candidate who desires to be selected as a delegate must post his name not less than sixty days in advance of the State convention, which obviously requires time. Moreover, the belief is general that the sooner the State con ventions can be held and delegates elected the sooner any tendency to factional differences will be dissipated and the gTeater will be the likeli hood of complete harmony in the Republican National Convention.

Mr. Barnes declared that, beyond having heard the rumor circulating in the lact week, he knew nothing of the matter. As far aa thla State Is concerned, said he, the nomination of delegates will follow the in variable custom and be by Congress districts. As a matter of fact, I expect to hear of some district calls before very long. It Is not in the least unusual to have one or two at least, as early as February. There is no question about the manner of electing them in this State. Governor Odell Is still confined to the Execu tive Mansion as the result of a bad throat, but over the telephone he would say nothing about the affair, declaring that he knew nothing about it.

The minister added that he had received a dis p4ftch' from Toklo denying- the staterafent that Japan was trying to induce Corea to recognize a Japanese protectorate. It Is practically certain that any declaration of war will not emiinate from Russia, said Baron Hayashi in an interview earlier in the day. The minister was not very hopeful of the result of the latest Japanese note, but he spe cifically denied that Japan's reply suggests the neutralization of a part of Manchuria as well as a part of Corea, or that mention ia made of the right to break off negotiations. He added Cur conditions are practically summed up In the concluding portion of the Stats Depart ment's announcement regarding the Cblno-Amer ican treaty. For these principles, to which Secretary Hay says the United States is irrev ocably committed, we are 'willing to go to war unless Russia will consent to give us a definite pledge that she, too, adheres to the open door and Chinese sovereignty In Manchuria. The Japanese government has taken the Nikko and the Kasuga, two new fast steamers of the Nippon Line, for use as dispatch vessels. A number of these steamers were used in the Chino-Japanese War. Sailings from London con tinue for the present, though all the Nippon Line sailings from Japan have been cancelled. There Is much diminution in freight, however, in consequence of the high premiums. HOPES HIGHER IN RUSSIA, Japan's Reply Seems Likely to Lead to More Conferences. St. Petersburg, Jan. 15. The Japanese Min ister, M. Kurino, to-day delivered the Japanese reply to the Foreign Office here. The reply ia now under consideration. The Foreign Office says that the present stage of the negotiations is In some respects in ad vance on previous 6toges. and that the two governments have approached an understanding on some points, but not on others. There was hopefulness to-day in many quar tern where pessimism formerly prevailed. Con servative opinion holds that, while the prospect of peace is better than ever, the end cannot be predicted with certainty, particularly the man ner in which a settlement can be obtained. The Intimation received here that President Roosevelt is selecting consuls to represent the United States at Moukden and An-Tunj, in Manchuria, the ports opened to commerce by the recently ratified treaty between the United States and China, was received as a matter of course. Continuing Its anti-war campaign, the Russ to-rtay predicts that, even granting that Russia is victorious, there will be subsequent inter ference on the part of other powers aud a new edition of the Berlin Congress.

Still, every consumer who apriV 1 for a test honestl beeves his matt-r to run fust, and t'nat R Is taken advantage of by tho tis company. .My experience Las taught me 'hat ths i ondltlon of the meter la not the cause of these hlh bills, except in very rui caws. The pro vailing opinion ferns to h.i that th rut manu factured at ''i present limu is of an inferior qual ity, and that It doea not possess the heating and illuminating power of tha as made lii former years. To enhance these deficient properties It be comes necessity to put .1 liiKh pressure on the flow of gas, a d 8 it passes through the meter it u- la tars, of course, much faster thn the as driven throug the meter by a normal or slower process, HANDSOME HOTEL FOR WASHINGTON.

Annual Appropriation Bill Intro duced Preaches Economy. Albany. Jan. 23 Th Annual Appropriation l.ill was Introduced In the Assembly to-night by Mr. Rogers, chairman of the Ways and Means Com mittee. It own total appropriations of sT7jBMSOI exclusive of reappropriatinns of uncxjer.dfd bal ances, amounting to Jl'jO.blj. and appropriations o revenue of trust funds, amounting to 3.11.500, neither of which enters into the general tax hlget. The total appropriations carried by the Annual Appropriation bill of last year, exclusive of reap propriations a trust funds, amounted to 17. 423.311 15. In explaining the hill Mr. Rogers said, in rart This Is an lricrea for this year over last yar of 200,779 en. Thfa result is due to certain necessary increases made In .ion departments, which are i.i part offset by decreases in others. Th total ln eaoasoa are eVXT, while the. decreases li other department.- are Jlt.,iCC23, Icatrtg the net increase above mentioned. The principal items which have made th's net In aroaSS nfcessar' are JlMj.'juO for the Department of Excise tor rebates upon surrendered liquor tax rertulcatts, for which no appropriation was made last year 30, for the State Kngineer and Sur veyor for the salaries and compensation of en gineers on the canals J3.Y additional for the care of the insane Jl't.tXV additional fOf the support of State prisons, and CMOS to tle Department of Ak ii'ulture for the r.ispe.-tn nt i.urseriea and tho ex termination of the San Jose ,.- It therefore behooves us to start upon our work for this session with the determination 10 keep the p.. -c'iia.tions down to the lowest possible mini mum consistent With the proper llschar- of obli gations now resting upon the State, and particu larly that we - j not commit the Stale to any further new policies until we have determined what tho .-.lre. iv adopted will ultimately require. Mr. Palmer said he. had thought the bill was merely Introduced for the purposes of publication. He objected to the introduction of a bill placing at a very low figure the stun for appropriations to k-ive the Impression that it was costing very little to run the Sta'.o. to be followed by the subsequent Introduction of aug-plr mentary appropriations and supply bi.ij. One appropriation and 011.3 supply Mil with a fixed charee should be sufllcient. The bill went back to the committee. BIG DECREASES SHOWN.

Congressman John Sharp Williams tells of a mar. in Mississippi who is a hypochondriac of the first order. This individual's failing is a source of never ending amusement to his fellow townsmen. It was of this man that some one humorously remarked, in answer to a question, as to how the sick man was getting on, that he complained that he was feeling somewhat better. Mr. Williams says that the hypochondriac was one day telling a friend of his efforts to regain his old time health. He ran over the list of tors whom, he had consulted. Whereupon the friend remarked 'Well, old man. I must say that you appear to have lots of faith in doctors. Certainly I have. replied the sick man. Don't you think the doctors would be foolish to let a good customer like me die", "New York"], ["t f 1 t I c r 1 9MY 1 H 1 V4r yV ft p 1It 1f f f y I r I f Jr V t viVv H 4 4 2 THE WORLD WEDNESDAY

CZAR FIBM FOR PEACE. PROCLAIMS HIS POLICY. Says He Will Do All in Ilia Power to Avert War with Japan. St. Petersburg. Jan. 14. I desire and intend to do all in my power to maintain peace In the Far East. These were the words which the Czar spoke to the members of the diplomatic corps at the yew Year's reception, hold in the Winter Palace ,t noon to-day. The Czar made a leisurely round' of the great arlJite hall, with its beautiful colonnades. In -hich the representatives of the various coun tries had assembled. He chatted freely with all and at considerable length with, several of the diplomats. Keen curiosity was exhibited by every one in the room when his majesty approached Mr. Kurtno, the Japanese Minister to Russia. The conversation between the Cxar and the minister was cordial and extended. His majesty em phasized the high value which he placed on the good and neighborly relations between Japan nd Russia, not only now, but In the future, and expressed his unshaken hope that a mutually tlsfactory settlement of the difficulties be tween the two countries would ' be arrange. IJlnister Kurino left the reception profoundly Impressed wlti hlrs majesty's words. Mr. Kurino, the Japanese Minister, informed the Associated Press correspondent that the Japanese reply had been handed to Baron de Rose., the Russian Minister at Tokio, and that he himself would present Count Lamsdorff, the Russian Foreign Minister, with a duplicate copy. The minister said he wm not authorized to state the terms of the reply, but he admitted that It Insured the continuance of negotiations con cerning the Far East so far as Japan was con cerned. TO KILL FOREIGXERS. IftgBMCTC Feared at Seoul Mr. Allen's Precautions. London, Jan. 15. The Seoul correspondent of The Daily Mail Fajs that the native press is advocating the slaughter of all foreigners. United States Minister Allen has ordered all American women and children to remain In doors, and he predicts that rioting by the mili tary Is Imminent. M.

It 1b eaJd that Japan's answer to Russia's latest note is not In the form of an ultimatum, and it Is described ag modrat in terms but resolute In tone. It Is said to be largely devote to a discussion of affairs connected with Corea, Japan having been Btrongly advised not to fight over Manchuria aJone.

Health Commissioner Darlington to Advertise Anew for Supply. The Ice Trust is doing, or trying to do, busi nesa at the old stand. It has doubled the price of Hb commodity In its bids to supply the Health Department with Jco thnt last year cost 27,. Commissioner Darlington of the Health Board yesterday decided to reject the trust's bid and readvertise for proposals. The American Ice Company last year fur nished the department now under my Jurisdic tion with Ice at 13 cents a hundred pounds, Fa Id Dr. Darlington. The b-ids opened to-day seem to be all from one concern, and the price Is raised from 13 to '2ft cents a hundred pounds. This Is so outrageous that I will not stand it. I have decided to reject the bids and try again. Tammany Hall is supposed to have come back to power as a protest against the so-called predatory trusts. The Ice Trust seems to have chosen the advent of Democracy's return to power as a fitting chance to double the price of Us commodity. I don't believe we shall be com pelled to buy ice from the trust at such an ap parently excessive price. Commissioner Darlington had a conference with Controller CJrout yesterday and it Is un derstood that thq Controller advised him with reference to tactics in fighting the Ice Trus'.. The American Ice Company gained notoriety on account of its promotion by the bad-rs of Tammany Hall in litol. Mayor Van Wyck and John F. Carroll were large stockholders In the company at that time and the company enjoyed water front privileges which enabled it to mo nopolize the ice business of the city. More recently an investigation committee of the stockholders, after an examination of the ice company's affaire, criticised pome Of its business methods.

James Cad mus, eleven years old, is in the custody of the Erie Railroad officials on the charge of having attempted to wreck a fast expiess on the New- York and Greenwood Lake Railway at Soho by placing a large bowlder on the tracks.

In addition to closing the churches, policemen were sent to guard a number of lodging houses, nnd the building ir. which a commercial college is situated was closed. This building must be remodelled extensively before it can be re opened, and the college In the mean time will seek other quarters.

Ther wil be no large fire permitted In the buldl.ig. only sufficient heat being provided to test the fusible caps on sprinklers. Tests of theatrical curtains will also be made, and the eff -ler.cy of all appliances required by the city fire ordlinncp.i will be demonstrate'. From action taken to-night by the City Coun cil It Is evident that the theatres here will not be able to reopen for smr.e time. The meeting of the Council was to consider the revision of the buildln ordinances, and It was generally expected that th- proposed amendments would be considered and adopted, s-o that the proprie tors of the theatres would know what would be demanded of them and would be able to begin their alterations at once. Hut thre has been much criticism of the proposed changes In the ordinances, and when the measure was called up to-night Alderman Mayor moved thai con sideration be deferred.

He Phot himself through the brain. Mr. Storm hart been talking about some busi ness in the oce. Ho bad been in good spirits. but suddenly he jumped from his seat and al most ran Into an inner office. The move did not excite suspicion, but an instant after Mr. Storm had entered the inner office the shot was heard and his partners rushed in Polite Headquarters was Immediately asked by telephone to Bend an ambulance quickly, ii.l a sin hi was soon on the spot. He said death had been almost Instantaneous. The offices of the company were at once closed and the body was sent to an undertaking estab lishment in West Twenty-third-st. Mr. Storm lived at the Hotel Savoy with his wife and two daughters. lit was a member of the Lotos Club, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and of the American Museum of Natural History.

Murphy's Man Serves Xotice That the Time Has Come. by Ttunurn to tup nnm.l Albany, Jan. 14. 1n a remarkable interview this afternoon, one of the Tammany Senators closest to Charles F. Murphy served notice on Chief Judge Alton B. Parker that if he wished to secure the support of Tammany he must come out in the open and repudiate David B. Hill. Dwelling on the sorry figure cut by Judge Parker' as a result of his timidity in allowing the use of his name nt the last Democratic con vention, declaring that the general impression was that Judge Parker must either be a weak man or entirely under the domination of ex- Senator Hill, this Democratic leader Invited Judge Parker to spaas for himself.- He said Is Senator Hill Judge Parkers authorized Warwick Why did h let Mr. HIU unreservedly shape his JesU'llea si the convention of IMS if he were not If ac hopes for the support of Tammany he must esped to declare for us and not for Hill. The Weal is hostile to Hill how will they regard a man who, at a critical time, allowed Hill entirely to dominate his ..pin ions and counteract his sense of duty to his party Senator afcCarren believed at the time of that convention that he had a tentative ac ceptance of a nomination from Judge Parker. There was a letter, so the rumor goes, making the matter even more d finite. Wcere dM the letter go and who suppressed it. and why did Judge Parker submit to thai suppression There was Hilly Sheehan. He was at that convention for Judge Parker first and last. H came away disheartened, discouraged Why did i Judge Parker dodge the issue We knew that I he was stronger in the country. We Tammany I men knew that he would even poll as many votes in the city as Coler. What was his ex cuse His friends said financial reasons, but any one know that, even if he had resigned from the bench, and had been defeated, he could have come to New-York and made S6 a year In private practice. Is that a sensible ex planation Now, there are people coming from the West who want to size up this man Parker. If he will break away from the alleged friendly re lations with David R Hill, himself a candidate for the Presidency since time immemorial, there may be some hope for him. But will he Has he go the sand, or is he a weak man That's what we want to know, and we have got to be informed. THE HILL, AND TAMMANY STORY. Hardly less interesting in regard to Hill than Parker Is this striking expression of the Tam many position. It would seem to settle definite ly the notion that Hill has crawled hack into the good graces of Tammany. It puts before the country a fair promise of disruption In the State if Tammany is opposed. The familiar cry that Judge Parker is an unknown quantity Is raised again, and the alleged candidate finds himself placed in the difficult position of having either to discard a friend or to lose the support of his own State, without which he cannot be seriously regarded as a candidate. The ultimatum called forth an Interesting comment from Charles N. Bulger. He declared earnestly that there was no difference between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Hill on the subject of the Presidential nomination. He did not add that there was any agreement. But the fact is be coming more and more apparent here that it Is Mr. Hill's friends who are declaring that the ex- Senator ha no hard feelings toward Mr. Mur phy. The Tammany leader's friends do not credit Mr Murphy with any such fraternal sprit tow ard Hill. Ex-Lieutenant Governor William F. Sheehan keeps constantly In touch with Judge Parker these days, nnd files off to New- York at inter vals on mysterious missions, but there is no reason to doubt now that a Tammany Senator has spoken his opinion, and that of the organ ization, that Judge Parker will be asked to de clare his hand. Ex-Senator Hill sat in his law office this after noon and read the account of the Tammany Sen ator's deliverance. Like Judge Parker, he never comments, never answers, never says a word for publication. In the present instance he fol lowed his usual course. So did Judge Parker. That William K. Hearst Is rapidly displacing Judge Pirker In the attention of the country was another startling assertion of one well known Democratic Senator, who ilatl- suggest ed that space rates were securing the support of many national Democrats. The real danger of the Hearst talk, according to this Senator, was that presently it would be taken seriously in other parts of the country, particularly If the Parker boom continued to flatten out at It 3 pres ent rate. GOIN'O TO SIZE IP PARKER. There was a rumor afloat to-night that the first of the Western Democrats who are planning to come to Albany and tag a look nt Judge Parker for the purpose of getting a true esti mate -f his calibre as Presidential timber was expected shortly. Thomas Taggart. National Commltteeman from Indiana, was reported to be coming. From another quarter this report was denied, and it is extremely doubtful If Taggart will come. Meanwhile. It Is interesting to watch the de velopment of Senrtor Patrick H. McCarren. He is to be crowned the Democratic leader at a din ner given by the Iemo-rUk- Senators on TUSe day nis'it.

RUMORS OF TREACHERY Long Delay in Issuing Call for Re publican National Convention, FROM the tribune nrr.EAr. Washington. Jan. 14. startling and apt parentry authentic rumor Involving treachery to President Roosevelt. if not to the national com mittee itself, on the part of the executive com mittee of that organization was in circulation at the Capitol to-day. From sources usually regarded as trustworthy came the Information that the reason lor the unprecedented delay In issuing the call for the Republican National Convention was due to an effort on the part of the executive com nittee to find an excuse lor ao altering the call as to preclude the possibility of selecting delegates for the respective Congress districts and to make necessary Instead the election of all delegates at large. The delay in Itself is already the occasion of surprise and annoyance to numerous tate or ganizations, and unless the call Is issued lrr. n'.-fliately serious inconvenience must ensue but the proposition to change the form of the call and defeat the desire of the party that the usual niethod of selecting delegates he pursued will, if carried out. create widespread indignation. Such a proposition is characterized with reser- vation as an attempt to control certain delega tions which would normally cast their votes far the President in the forthcoming convention, ant. If persisted In. must result in war t tap knife. It is known that in Ohio Senator Fcraker wi control certain delegates, provided the selection is by Congress districts, but Their -.election .-s delegates at large might materially alter thi course of events, and a similar situation prevails in other States. It Is not believed by Senators and others whrv are supposed to have a thorough knowledge c the rules of Republican conventions that any Justification for such a course can be found by th executive committee, although there is a. possibility that some resolution conferring 3uch, power on the committee may have been, unwit tingly adopted by the committee, as was tha case with the resolution which confers on th chairman cf the national committee the power to fill any vacancies which may occur. In any event, should the national committee, determine to take the course outlined, It will meet with the strongest opposition. There Is every reason to believe that not only the lead ers, but the rank and file of the party, would resent such an attempt to defeat the popular will, and would seek redress in one form or an other. Postmaster General Payne, vice-chairman oC the National Committee, declared to-day that there could be no truth in the rumor, because he. as vice-chairman, had heard nothing of It. On the other hand, it is maintained that other members of the committee would readily appre-i ciite the delicate position in which they would place Mr. Payne by Informing him of such a plan, and would naturally refrain from taking him Into their confidence while he remained a member of Mr. Roosevelt's Cabinet. Sufficient importance is attached to the rumoil to cause Senator Penrose to withhold the call for the Pennsylvania State Convention, and the call, already prepared, but not sent out. stilt Has on the desk of Major Andrews, secretary of the Republican State Commit MeanwMla Senator Pen rose has ordered a complete search of th proceedings of Republican conventions, and has gone to Philadelphia to-night, presuma bly to consult Senator Quay and other leaders of the party in his State. It is now five weeks since the meeting el th National Committee, and no call for the Na tional Convention has been Issued, although Senator Manna has received numerous messages and letters from party loaders in all parta of the country urging expedition. Postmaster General Payne explains that, al though such delay is entirely unprecedented, tha call hiving been issued within a weak m a' previous occasions, it Is perfectly natural, si Chairman Hanna and Secretary Heath hive been very busy. The Postmaster General fur ther avers that the call i merely a formality and of no vital Importance. Some of the President's most earnest support ers, however, do no take this view of the case. They ay that the course of the Pennsylvania Republicans in calling, as they expect to. ths State Convention in advance of the issue of thi national call, is irregular, and. were there a rival faction in the field, miht lead to the calling ef subsequent convention, the selection of a, ond delegation and a contest which would be decided by the more powerful element In th- National Convention, while the virtue of beingf the more regular would He with the delegation selected pursuant to the national call. No aneh danger M apprehended in Pennsylvania, who.- the part- organization is characterized by com plete harmony, but there are States where su li embarrassing circumstances might arise. Massachusetts will soon follow the example of Pennsylvania and call it State convention with out waiting fo- the national call, and there is believed to be no danger of complications there nevertheless, the delay Is pregnant with the pos sibilities of confusion and contests in the na tional convention. The laws in some States are very explicit re garding the preliminary advertising of a Stata convention. It is customary to give this ad vertising to the weekly papers, and that com pels time enough for several weekly issues. The. time is already growing short, and it is easy j conceive how further delay may contribute to technical defects in State cal3, advertising and other details, and thus contribute to the likeli hood of contesting delegations. I'mler these circumstances the patience of tha President's friends is fast beecmins exhausted. and great pressure will be exerted on the committee to issue the call immeu. and in the usual form, within the next few gag s.
