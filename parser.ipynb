Jai 7 A high Japanese au\\nthority made the following explana\\ntion of the'status of the Far Eastern\\nsituation:\\n\\\"-The\\\" statement that Russia has\\nmade concessions to Japan is not ex\\nact On the contrary Russia, in the\\nmonth of October, made certain con\\ncessions which were accepted by\\nJapan, subsequently withdrew them,\\nand assumed an attitude which left the\\nJapanese little hope in the way of\\nreaching a satisfactory agreement.\\n\\\"The Japanese government, confi\\ndent in the declarations of disinterest\\nedness in Manchuria made by Russia\\nand recognizing Russia's special inter\\nests in that region, wished to regulate,\\nonce for all, all Questions in the Far\\nEast in the interest of future peace!\\nand tranquillity. Te this end Japan\\nmade the following proposals:\\n\\\"FirstRussia and Japan should'\\nmutually respect the independence\\nand territorial integrity of China and\\nKorea.\\n\\\"SecondTo recognize reciprocally'\\nJapan the special interests of Russia\\nin Manchuria, Russia the special in-'\\nterests of Japan In Korea.\\n\\\"ThirdTo engage mutually not to\\nInfringeJapan the commercial rights,\\nand immunities acquired by Russia in\\nKorea, Russia the commercial rights i\\nand immunities acquired by Japan in:\\nManchuria.\\n\\\"In making the third proposition]\\nJapan wished not only to protect her\\nown rights in China and those of RusJ\\nsia in Korea, but to consecrate by\\nthe principal of equality of treatment!\\nthe commercial rights of all nations]\\nin Korea and China.\\n\\\"Russia declined the Japanese\\npropositions and submitted a counter,1\\nproposition which contained a clause:\\nproviding for the creation of a neutral'\\nzone extending from tho China-Korean\\nfrontier to Wongtan on the east and\\nto Pingyank on the west. The zone\\ncomprised almost a third of Korea.\\n\\\"This Russian pretension took from\\nJapan all guarantee of the\\nProtection of Her Rights\\nin Manchuria and sequestrated a con-'\\nsiderable part of Korea, where, with\\nout contradiction, Japan's Interests\\npreponderate, and which every nation\\nrecognizes as being within the legiti\\nmate sphere of Japan.\\n\\\"The proposal exasperated Japan\\nese public opinion.\\n\\\"Japan could not accept the pro\\nposal for several reasons.\\n\\\"Everyone knows that by the new\\ntreaties concluded by the United]\\nStates and Japan with China one city\\nand-two ports were to be opened to\\nthe commerce of the world. Autung.\\nTchong and Mukden wore the points\\nchosen. By the occupation of these\\nports Russia prevented China from ful\\nfilling the obligations of her treaties, i\\n\\\"In Korea, equally, acts of Russia\\nhave had as a result, the closing of tho\\nYalu river to foreign commerce. Japan\\nasks Korea, simultaneously with tho\\nUnited States and Oreat Britain, to\\nopen this region to international com\\nmerce. In occupying Yong Wang Pou\\n(Yongampho), the only port in North\\nKorea, Russia paralyzed the realiza\\ntion of this project. Japan then had\\nreason to fear that letting Russia\\nalono would result in closing the Yel\\nlow sea an I the interior of Manchu\\nria to international commerce.\\n\\\"In struggling with all her force\\nagainst, the pretensions of Hussia in\\ntin? Far East Japan works not only\\nfor herself but for all nations. Japan\\ndoes not ignore the dangers and risks\\nof an armed conflict with Russia and\\ndoes not enibark upon it. with a light\\nheart, or as a fanforonade. II will be\\nless a struggle betsveen races than a\\nplan for the preservation of interna\\ntional commerce.\\\"\\nTV/O THOUSAND KILLED.\\nChinese Troops Destroy a Village to\\nCapture a Bandit.\\nShanghai, Jan. 7.It has been\\nlearned that in effecting the capture\\nof the notorious bandit.

She will\\nbe required to steam IS knots an hour\\nfor four consecutive hours.\\nThe main buttery will consist of\\nfour 12-lnch breech loading rifles, two\\nmounted forward and two aft; eight\\n8-lnch breech loading rifles find twelve\\n7-lnch breech loading rifles. In the\\nsecondary battery will be twenty 3-\\ninch 14-pounder rapid fire guns; six 1-\\npounder automatic guns; two 1-pound\\ner semi-automatic guns; two 3-lnch\\nfieldpieces; two machine and six auto\\nmatic guns. The 12-lnch pieces will\\nbe mounted in pairs in two electrically\\ncontrolled balanced elliptical turrets.\\nThe 7-inch guns will be mounted in\\nbroadside on pedestais on the gun\\ndeck behind 7-inch armor.\\nThe hull of the battleship is of steel\\nthroughout. It Is protected at the\\nwater-line by a complete belt of ar\\nmor 9 feet 3 inches wide, having a\\nmaximum thickness of eleven Inches\\nfor about 200 feet amidships.\\nThe engines are of the vertical,\\ntwin-screw, four-cylinder, triple-ex\\npansion type, of a combined horse\\npower of 16,500. There are twelve\\nboilers placed in six water-tight com\\npartments. There are three funnels,\\neach 100 feet high above the base\\nline.\\nThe Vermont was designed as a\\nflagship.
